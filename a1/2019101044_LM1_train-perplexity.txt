'You are\neach of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so\neasy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will\nalways exceed your income.'	2.5947836434474834
'They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I\nsometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant\ncompliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to\ngive them as unstudied an air as possible.'	2.5948346824902795
'You were\nnot by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it.'	2.5953051891820866
'We must not make him desperate.'	2.5961946584600493
'The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his\nfigure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own\nfeelings, followed them in silence.'	2.596589274517067
"My aunt's intelligence had given me\nhope, and I was determined at once to know every thing."	2.5966064836887814
"She was not of so ungovernable a\ntemper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she\nbecame, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less\nignorant, and less insipid."	2.596964634323651
'And as to laughter, we will not expose\nourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.'	2.597215519119126
'Mr Darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can\n     spare from me.'	2.5975278743685317
"The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to\nMr Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could\nbring no proof of its injustice."	2.5983970251649477
'I did not wink at you.'	2.5990541506430502
'Presuming, however,\nthat this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than\nany dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of\nsociety, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for\nher attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.'	2.600169649577903
'He was received by Mr\nBennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed,\nespecially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of\nher curtsey and address to his friend.'	2.600216244320267
'Certainly, Sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue\namongst the less polished societies of the world.--Every savage can\ndance.'	2.600341682324077
'She put down the\nletter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be\nimpartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with\nlittle success.'	2.600488892163216
'He meant, I believe,  replied Jane,  to go to Epsom, the place where\nthey last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could\nbe made out from them.'	2.6005641947388902
'My poor father!'	2.601111017217053
'The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his\nside, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason\nto hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day\nwould be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.'	2.601222509141731
'That  she  could\nbe in any danger from the deception never entered my head.'	2.6018444693795915
'She\nconcluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally\nfortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no\nchance of it.'	2.6020595636363453
'So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and\nasked her for the two next.'	2.6020685265593757
"Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching\nmarriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere."	2.6027193810621276
'He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration\nshould  now  escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of\ninfluencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been\nsuggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight\nin confirming or crushing it.'	2.603163181779027
'Did you speak from your own observation,  said she,  when you told him\nthat my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?'	2.6031773560546583
'When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in\nsearch of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.'	2.603393592153194
'Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine, what is to\nbefall her?'	2.6039690758849225
'There was one part\nespecially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the\npower of reading again.'	2.604486743688163
'This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too\nlate to be saving.'	2.6047786904904697
'I am not qualified to form one.'	2.6050551981574954
'Their parties\nabroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and\nsister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around\nthem, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty\nmight in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers\nof her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition\ngreater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her\nfolly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering\nplace and a camp.'	2.605820509892458
'She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information\nof their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,\nand of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr\nHurst had a house.'	2.6061959875686482
"On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the\nfirmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion."	2.6062826096202754
'But what is to be\ndone about Pemberley?'	2.606385401033173
'It is natural that obligation should be\nfelt, and if I could  feel  gratitude, I would now thank you.'	2.6065310452533073
'He was struggling for the\nappearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed\nhimself to have attained it.'	2.6065657259044506
"But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the\nparticulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions\nto the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three\nthousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate."	2.606635571263222
'She was not equal,\nhowever, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together,\ncould attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the\nextraordinary kindness she was treated with.'	2.606995061976101
"I dare say the\nlace upon Mr Hurst's gown---- \n\nHere she was interrupted again."	2.607154156688877
'And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying\nbooks.'	2.607224270275487
'But what,  said she, after a pause,  can have been his motive?--what\ncan have induced him to behave so cruelly?'	2.607473180398984
'Yes, I have had a letter from him by express.'	2.6077743306087062
'I had not\nbelieved it possible.'	2.6078800881971187
'We both know that he has been profligate in every\nsense of the word.'	2.6079272072556283
'Catherine and Lydia had\ninformation for them of a different sort.'	2.608032210518211
'Not at all,  he replied;  they were brightened by the exercise.'	2.60806310929777
'My dear aunt, how could you think of it?'	2.608331432650244
'Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know\nwhat they were talking of.'	2.6085187371751197
'But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,  replied\nher uncle.'	2.6094979404105034
'I declare I do not\nknow a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in\nparticular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening\nwhen he has nothing to do.'	2.6098710142068713
'Of his former way of life,\nnothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself.'	2.6099458044155357
'who have\noften disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my\nvanity, in useless or blameable distrust.--How humiliating is this\ndiscovery!--Yet, how just a humiliation!--Had I been in love, I could\nnot have been more wretchedly blind.'	2.6101620839155517
"The envelope contained a\nsheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's\nfair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as\nshe read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages."	2.611141049861837
'Would to heaven that any\nthing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer\nconsolation to such distress.--But I will not torment you with vain\nwishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.'	2.6113899189088703
'Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with\nmany people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few\nneighbourhoods larger.'	2.6116933664046633
'And since this sad\naffair has taken place, it is said, that he left Meryton greatly in\ndebt; but I hope this may be false.'	2.611773010582703
'Give my love to Colonel Forster, I hope you\n     will drink to our good journey.'	2.6119274937700987

'Bingley met them with hopes\nthat Mr Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.'	2.6121460828228265
'The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was\nenough to provoke him.'	2.6121838101431667
'She listened most\nattentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\nexpression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,\nhis taste, or his good manners.'	2.612186554835975
'His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but\n     a little more liveliness, and  that , if he marry  prudently , his\n     wife may teach him.'	2.612310601122952
'My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in\nsuch confusion!'	2.6126736859449182
'Mr Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had\nbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character.'	2.612708012415283
"It must have been his sister's doing."	2.612828306090654
'&c.; and if she would\ngive him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.'	2.6128929319767162
'Mr Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her\nDerbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.'	2.613015075124582
'She is happy, then,  said her father, drily;  and her residence there\nwill probably be of some duration.'	2.613191339573949
'You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr Darcy?'	2.6132508697754093
"She was\nsorry that Mr Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so\nlittle suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the\nunhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him."	2.613429051323427
'I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year\nor two.'	2.6135655269944356

"His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her\ndeserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret."	2.614283645714139
'Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was\naccepted with alacrity.'	2.614459046902766
'I think you said she was a widow, sir?'	2.614516296274008
'Towards  him  I have been\nkinder than towards myself.'	2.6145381283468416

"His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being\nadmitted into her family again, before she set off for the North,\nreceived at first an absolute negative."	2.6149812498530776
"Elizabeth had frequently\nunited with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine\nand Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,\nwhat chance could there be of improvement?"	2.6152655666420728
'I cannot think of it without abhorrence.'	2.615284742054077
'Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from\ndoing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.'	2.6154858372984764
'Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table\nwhere a few books were lying.'	2.615986283764773

'Who\ncould have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there\n(an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after\nyour arrival!'	2.616988693789422
'She is unfortunately of a sickly\nconstitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many\naccomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am\ninformed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still\nresides with them.'	2.617218201025564
'His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his\n     circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me\n     to others, as in his reproaches to myself.'	2.6173976430066026
'Mr Darcy, who never looks at any\nwoman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at  you  in\nhis life!'	2.6174383584839536
'She is all affability and condescension, and I\ndoubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when\nservice is over.'	2.6177783909924353

'How can Mr Bingley,\nwho seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,\nbe in friendship with such a man?'	2.6188522075585605
'It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,  he added,\n which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.'	2.6191089311626534
"And now here's Mr Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight\nWickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is\nto become of us all?"	2.619155722444798
"Charlotte had seen\nthem from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running\ninto the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,\n\n I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility."	2.619209109557865

'John told us Mr Darcy was\nhere when you sent for us;--was it so?'	2.6198222472534685
'She was very wrong in singling me out as\n     she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on\n     her side.'	2.620193822155118
"He was declared to be in debt\nto every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with\nthe title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family."	2.62066374963957
"Her pale face and impetuous\nmanner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to\nspeak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's\nsituation, hastily exclaimed,  I beg your pardon, but I must leave you."	2.620768769264398
'Mr Darcy was\n     punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the\n     wedding.'	2.6209479311485326

'I do not believe she often sees such at home.'	2.6228051695787644

'The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the\nday before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought\nonly six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin.'	2.62297016110254
'I came to you without a\ndoubt of my reception.'	2.62326109994876

'My temper I dare not vouch\nfor.--It is I believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the\nconvenience of the world.'	2.623953624564746

'I only fear that\nthe sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding,\nis merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and\njudgment he stands much in awe.'	2.62481089489638
'And  that  made the men suspect\nsomething, and then they soon found out what was the matter.'	2.6254626061555353
'And there was my\naunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if\nshe was reading a sermon.'	2.62578494529261
"Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with\nall that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the\nfear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves\ninferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved."	2.6264766945176494

"Mr Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in\nconversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high\ndiversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the\ngreatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh\nlooked that way."	2.6270519595651183
"Elizabeth listened with\ndelight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of\nBingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence\nin it."	2.6271417487709487
'They\nhad nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if\nnot, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small\nmarket-town, where the family did not visit.'	2.627175156035827

"Lady\nCatherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his\ncomfort, appeared very remarkable."	2.6342847665455342
'They have none of them much to recommend them,  replied he;  they are\nall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\nquickness than her sisters.'	2.634294066232975
'Mr Collins\nreceived and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\nproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result\nof which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the\nrefusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow\nfrom her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.'	2.6342989180431586
'Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an\ninterview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\ncalmness, if he really intended to meet them.'	2.63478369227964
'She grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--Of neither Darcy nor Wickham\ncould she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,\nprejudiced, absurd.'	2.6347869963306065
'I am sincerely grieved for him and\n     Mr F. but no one can throw any blame on them.'	2.635229643775699
"Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters\nwas exactly what Darcy had hoped to see."	2.6352827147769804
"Mr Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\npleasure to Mr Bennet."	2.635514405446299
'They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,\nwhile examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of\nmeeting its owner returned.'	2.6356139116418005
'His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his\nattentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling\nherself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the\nothers.'	2.6361046458026163
'It was a subject, in short, on\nwhich reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.'	2.6369259950279016
'It is amazing to me,  said Bingley,  how young ladies can have patience\nto be so very accomplished, as they all are.'	2.636933801488548
'He added, that Mr\nBennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and\npromised to write again very soon.'	2.636979251749078
'My dear Lizzy, they must\n     have passed within ten miles of us.'	2.6373222158244114
'For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.'	2.637545215159081
"and she coloured at the\nidea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone,  And pray, what is\nthe usual price of an Earl's younger son?"	2.6378442203759063
"That  will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;\nbut it will have no effect on  me ."	2.638110238216593
"His plan did not vary on seeing them.--Miss Bennet's lovely face\nconfirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what\nwas due to seniority; and for the first evening  she  was his settled\nchoice."	2.6381393722449267
'Elizabeth hoped she had\nsilenced him; but he soon afterwards said,\n\n I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.'	2.6384910577208167
'Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with\nall her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.'	2.638621991853179
'It had always been evident to her that such an\nincome as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in\ntheir wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to\ntheir support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or\nherself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance\ntowards discharging their bills.'	2.6386938068111343
'Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,\nfor very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to\nthink necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with\nignorance.'	2.6387310196873095
'Had he done his duty in that\nrespect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of\nhonour or credit could now be purchased for her.'	2.6388831273092936
'MY DEAR LIZZY,\n\n      I wish you joy.'	2.639090923487664
'I should not have been allowed to invite them.'	2.639174515435007
'If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act\n     in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will\n     immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper\n     settlement.'	2.6393924663151718
'But I will endeavour to banish every painful\n     thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,\n     and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.'	2.640059500448887
"At first there\nseemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most\ndetermined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,\nshe soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets\nand exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in\nparticular."	2.6402482508953593
'Mr Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\nneighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he\nhad yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but\nvery intelligible gallantry.'	2.6406387094395267
'Engraved for No. 72 of La Belle Assemblee 1^{st} July 1815  \n\n\n\n\nPRIDE & PREJUDICE.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession\nof a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.'	2.640764860999259
'Their visits to Mr Philips were now productive of the most interesting\nintelligence.'	2.6413431081588277
'But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew.'	2.641608571891238
'This is not to be borne.'	2.642498530277085
'On distinguishing the ladies of the group,\nthe two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual\ncivilities.'	2.6426740084642564
'Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.'	2.642702582195029
'Mr Hurst\nthought the same, and added,\n\n She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent\nwalker.'	2.643377036220962
'Had you not been really\namiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you\ntook to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and\nin your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously\ncourted you.'	2.6435226300398083
'And when you have given  your  ball,  she\nadded,  I shall insist on their giving one also.'	2.643534988256862
'Dining out,  said Mr Bennet,  that is very unlucky.'	2.643771125597055
'I am going to-morrow\nwhere I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has\nneither manner nor sense to recommend him.'	2.6438771857472743
'cried Mr Gardiner, whose curiosity\nas to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.'	2.643973245523104
'He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as\nElizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.'	2.644331812778169
"When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's\ncharacter, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had\nseldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it\nalmost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful."	2.6448364461359257
'Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up\nstairs together.'	2.6451054168285433
'There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\ngive me no hope from law.'	2.6454834565782317
'You appear to me, Mr Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of\nfriendship and affection.'	2.645504252855213
'I shall write again as soon as any\n     thing more is determined on.'	2.6469742843429906
"Mr Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was\neagerly calling out, while her daughter read,\n\n Well, Jane, who is it from?"	2.647282375221
'You will not find\nhim more favourably spoken of by any one.'	2.6473791308544947
'Miss Bingley\nsucceeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr Darcy looked\nup.'	2.647541159059333
'This was agreed to, and Mr Philips\nprotested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\ntickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.'	2.647674288509172
'In his present\nbehaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,\nfor the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which\nhad marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after\nwhat had since passed, to provoke her.'	2.648290709420908
'But you forget, mama,  said Elizabeth,  that we shall meet him at the\nassemblies, and that Mr Long has promised to introduce him.'	2.6482933750430195
'Lydia, my love, though you  are \nthe youngest, I dare say Mr Bingley will dance with you at the next\nball.'	2.6483521534093564
'This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we\n     have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject\n     it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty\n     towards Mr Wickham.'	2.648477002059217
'I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of\nthing.--Young women should always be properly guarded and attended,\naccording to their situation in life.'	2.648889826174355
'Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases\ncame to meet Maria and hear the news:'	2.649188540763142
'The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing\non the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the\ncarriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their\nfaces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of\ncapers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.'	2.6493508715929974
'Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he\nmay never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.'	2.6493742883045486
"She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new\nclothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of\nshame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they\ntook place."	2.6493783081552373
'Whatever I do is done in a hurry,  replied he;  and therefore if I\nshould resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five\nminutes.'	2.6495876651670844
"Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then\ntalked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from\nher, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte,\nstationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's\ncountenance."	2.6497072421611247
'If he could any how\ndiscover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he\ndetermined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible\nto find out the stand and number of the coach.'	2.6501262322726706
'Very odd!--And you only the\nsecond.--The younger ones out before the elder are married!--Your\nyounger sisters must be very young?'	2.6502026375374923
"Mr Collins readily assented,\nand a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced\nit to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging\npardon, protested that he never read novels.--Kitty stared at him, and\nLydia exclaimed.--Other books were produced, and after some deliberation\nhe chose Fordyce's Sermons."	2.650323725219497
'The walk being here less\nsheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they\nmet.'	2.6504951331072517
'Not a word passed\nbetween the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in\nthe happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr Darcy\nreturned within the stated time.'	2.6512609543755814
'Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the\nprincipal object.'	2.651409038599248
'She had obtained private intelligence that Mr\nDarcy did not wish for cards; and Mr Hurst soon found even his open\npetition rejected.'	2.651510632829813
'This preservative she had now\nobtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been\nhandsome, she felt all the good luck of it.'	2.651540377557754
'The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed\none of the gates into the ground.'	2.6515797859421366
'Her heart was divided between concern\nfor her sister, and resentment against all the others.'	2.65168629064233
'When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having\npromised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.'	2.651744929132729
'Take your choice, but you must be satisfied\nwith only one.'	2.652018554226043
'Lizzy, you must not do so.'	2.652120926564607
'Darcy was delighted with\ntheir engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of\nit.'	2.6528755379465827
'But pride--where there is a real\nsuperiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.'	2.652928998783229
'Of having another daughter married to Mr Collins, she thought\nwith equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.'	2.6537677785266243
'But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\nacknowledge?'	2.6540977108486974
'Had she merely  dined  with him, she might\nonly have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must\nremember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four\nevenings may do a great deal.'	2.654213116403681
'But I\ncannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly\nbestowed it most unwillingly.'	2.6543697231890224
"The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would\nreturn Mr Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to\ndinner."	2.65438998993792
"He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the\nhundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket\nallowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her,\nthrough her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very little within\nthat sum."	2.655567243094397
"There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King."	2.6559195541759437
"Be that as it may, she saw him go\nwith regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must\nproduce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched\nbusiness."	2.6559372572198705
'To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as\nher ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.'	2.6561234086654637
'Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep\nin mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to\nhide it, not doing its office.'	2.6564393082883315
'I am not one and twenty.'	2.656445096157962
'They attacked him\nin various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and\ndistant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at\nlast obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour\nLady Lucas.'	2.6566497231165727
'How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr Darcy,  she cried;  I\nnever in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.'	2.656915848026288

'When they\nhad gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,\n\n This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a\ngood deal.'	2.6571590759667947
'There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his\nletter, which promises well.'	2.6571859338806267
'Mr Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor\nagreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be\nimaginary.'	2.65745904452373
'His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards\nMr Darcy with a very expressive smile.'	2.65830383035546
'But I will not be alarmed though your sister  does  play so well.'	2.6587092593212724
'I have suspected it some time, but\nI am now convinced.'	2.659008316423588
'So near\na vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to\n his  easy temper, or  her  affectionate heart.'	2.659049850332281
'After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued,  I  do  remember\nhis boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his\nresentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.'	2.6590749061840757
'Upon my word!--Well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as\nif----but however, it may all come to nothing you know.'	2.659196549402365
'I have just had a letter from\nJane, with such dreadful news.'	2.6595025993501067
'After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.'	2.6596307983138154
'After waiting at home every morning\nfor a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the\nvisitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,\nthe alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no\nlonger.'	2.6597660238513754
'Since such were her\n     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a\n     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he\n     easily learnt, had never been  his  design.'	2.659826899810805
'Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing\nthe Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.'	2.6600896244187697
'An union of a different tendency, and\nprecluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their\nfamily.'	2.660271754545159
'And\nwhen we  do  return, it shall not be like other travellers, without\nbeing able to give one accurate idea of any thing.'	2.660377213089086
'The perpetual\ncommendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness\nof his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern\nwith which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was\nexactly in unison with her opinion of each.'	2.6608188267199187
'Your profusion\nmakes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will\nbe as light as a feather.'	2.6612425228736365
'If you believed it impossible to be true,  said Elizabeth, colouring\nwith astonishment and disdain,  I wonder you took the trouble of coming\nso far.'	2.661275207203727
'The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every\nfemale of the family.'	2.661381313806024
'You are mistaken.'	2.6621894345301698
'He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.'	2.6622044800855744
'Here was knowledge in which no one could\npartake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect\nunderstanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this\nlast incumbrance of mystery.'	2.6622142567239546
'But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what\nI think of persons you esteem.'	2.6623115809570135
'Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my\npositive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I\nhave often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the\nblessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.'	2.6624070208193094
'She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked\nup and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks\nof enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.'	2.6624358047395194
'Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to\nsuppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was\nready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very\nsincerely wish him happy.'	2.662568120165121
'As a clergyman, moreover, I\n     feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in\n     all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds\n     I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly\n     commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the\n     entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side,\n     and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch.'	2.662631160091514
'How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned!'	2.6626447434746487
'He has\nchildren of his own, and may have more.'	2.6627396634142007
'Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange\nwith rather more precision the degree of importance which is to\nappertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting\nbetween the parties?'	2.662741601678466
"Elizabeth had mentioned her\nname to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of\nintroduction had been made."	2.663028440470963
'Elizabeth preserved as steady a\nsilence as either Mr Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too\nmuch fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of  Lord,\nhow tired I am!'	2.663328117400751
'They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her\nuncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by\nthemselves.'	2.663528757547985
'I will not encourage\nthe impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.'	2.6636808349660015
'Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the\npreservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was\nhurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill\napplied.'	2.663874261679678
'Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,\nheard it in silent indignation.'	2.664159207315273
'Mr Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during\ntheir visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested\nthem both.'	2.6643362627409886
'By all means,  cried Bingley;  let us hear all the particulars, not\nforgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more\nweight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of.'	2.664868013443316
'Mr Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table\ncould divide them.'	2.6649880673034354
'There is a gentleman with him, mamma,  said Kitty;  who can it be?'	2.6652688836730167
"On the\ngentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with\ntolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any\nsymptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance."	2.6657852977611114
'Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the\nvisit.'	2.666078236295738
'You must feel it; and the usual\nsatisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because\nyou have always so much.'	2.6666220496445288
"It is Mr Wickham's intention to go\n     into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still\n     some who are able and willing to assist him in the army."	2.6666340293220707
"This\nunfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure\nof seeing you at Pemberley to-day."	2.66663822871051
'cried he, with an air of awkward\ngallantry;  and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express\nauthority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of\nbeing acceptable.'	2.6667743476059567
'the ladies had crowded round the table,\nwhere Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,\nin so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her,\nwhich would admit of a chair.'	2.66699101768373
'Come, Darcy,  said he,  I must have you dance.'	2.667297845825552
'Whatever my connections may be,  said Elizabeth,  if your nephew does\nnot object to them, they can be nothing to  you .'	2.6674725684081793
'But vanity, not love, has been my\nfolly.--Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect\nof the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted\nprepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were\nconcerned.'	2.667683851993504
'Soon after\n     you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what\n     part of London they were.'	2.667829969987683

"Mr Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr Collins for\na few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation\nwere very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh."	2.6680824017303744
'But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr Wickham, when\nshe read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which,\nif true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which\nbore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings\nwere yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.'	2.6680980570356234
'But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most\nnatural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging.'	2.668306841280284
"Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin\nElizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate\nclosure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be\ninclined to take immediate advantage of."	2.668321645940182
'DOVE-DALE \n\n\n\n\nPRIDE & PREJUDICE.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nElizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of\nPemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned\nin at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.'	2.6687595776941895

'To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,\nand who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine\ntheir own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the\ninterval of waiting appeared very long.'	2.669486433797154
'With a strong\nprejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of\nwhat had happened at Netherfield.'	2.6694982164491887
'Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was\nthe case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed\nand rejoiced in his domestic comforts.'	2.6700801838668626
"Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture\nthey had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two\nthat they now saw Mr Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on\nbeholding his master, must immediately have told it."	2.670102144773379
'His appearance was\ngreatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine\ncountenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.'	2.6705577865768255
'I am only resolved to act in that manner,\nwhich will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without\nreference to  you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.'	2.670613400390151

'It would have spared her from\nexplanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;\nbut they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of\nher attachment to Mr Darcy.'	2.6708742604475844
'He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the\ntrouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which\nsupplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and\ndespise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,\npersuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to\navoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.'	2.6713671028599775
'When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them\na good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;\nand Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her\nhand to both.'	2.6715094824352383
'He who, she had been\npersuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this\naccidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without\nany indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where\ntheir two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion\nof her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.'	2.6715649255713303
'I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of\n     our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the\n     various creditors of Mr Wickham in and near Brighton, with\n     assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself.'	2.6716914861302925

'At that instant she felt,\nthat years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for\nmoments of such painful confusion.'	2.671814305481237
'We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest\npart of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,\nsharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.'	2.6718550191908768
"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's\nimmediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour."	2.6724833378434787
'It was not to be supposed that any other\npeople could be meant than those with whom she was connected.'	2.673036807319671

'Their\narrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets; and Jane more especially,\nwho gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had  she \nbeen the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must\nendure.'	2.6734044007132898
'No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very\ngood luck, I may meet with another Mr Collins in time.'	2.673583078103678
'Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and\nbefore he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she\ninterrupted him with,\n\n Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard,\nand if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.'	2.6742651236740893
'Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely\nrecollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which\nhad been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have\nfixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.'	2.674572251034174
'And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr Darcy, whose\nreception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at\nbeing so addressed was very evident.'	2.6749245869191283
'Nay,  cried Bingley,  this is too much, to remember at night all the\nfoolish things that were said in the morning.'	2.675089084838944
"The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the\nLucas's last week; and even Mr Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges\nwere remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French\ncooks at least."	2.675347241243141

"But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,\nlaughingly answered,\n\n No, no; stay where you are.--You are charmingly group'd, and appear to\nuncommon advantage."	2.676199222080878

"Mr Bennet, we shall have her\nat Netherfield at last.' She did indeed."	2.6782012846329075
"Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded\nof her sister's ready acquiescence."	2.6782608741960665
"But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures\ncontinued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving\nhome."	2.6785694715363695
'Dearest Jane!'	2.678627099753419

'He must write his own sermons; and the time\nthat remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\nand improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making\nas comfortable as possible.'	2.6787951739940543
'Never, even in the company\nof his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at\nRosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\nself-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could\nresult from the success of his endeavours, and when even the\nacquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw\ndown the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and\nRosings.'	2.6789863638342006
'then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.'	2.6790325176263385

"The comfort to  her ,\nof the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression."	2.6795414373751347
"But if you have got them to-day,  said Elizabeth,  my mother's purpose\nwill be answered."	2.679769578461623
"She was proceeding\ndirectly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr Darcy's\nsometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,\nshe turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road."	2.6804204566938807
'With the kindest concern he\n     came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner\n     most creditable to his heart.'	2.680711813915785

'He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we\ncannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a\npartner?'	2.6808026390414903
'At his own ball he\noffended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and I\nspoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer.'	2.681207583767074
'--My mind however is now made up on\n     the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been\n     so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right\n     Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh,\n     whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable\n     rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to\n     demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be\n     ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are\n     instituted by the Church of England.'	2.6812355662688687
'You will only think I feel  more  than I ought to do, when I\ntell you all.'	2.681440134244489
"But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had\nbelieved it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to\nrender Mr Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a\nturn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole."	2.681463762736872

'I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,\nand am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.'	2.6845411056758546
'And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all,\nsince you went away.'	2.685464517613516
"All were struck with the stranger's air,\nall wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if\npossible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of\nwanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained\nthe pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same\nspot."	2.6854893290605895
'Mr Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family\nprejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her\nmaster, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his\nmany merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.'	2.685510223518641
'But I can assure the young ladies that I come\nprepared to admire them.'	2.6855687291239136
'The satisfaction of\nprevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be\nher husband, might then have rested in its proper place.'	2.6861174776216723

'They can\nonly wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can\nsecure it.'	2.686758316395349
'Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,\nand down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest\nof this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the\ngarden gate.'	2.6873428816205847
'But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was\nshortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by\nan article of news, which then began to be in circulation.'	2.6874522871975683
'They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon\nMaria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,\nwhen Kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone.'	2.687567344197387
'When I consider,  she added, in a yet\nmore agitated voice,  that  I  might have prevented it!-- I  who knew\nwhat he was.'	2.6881390575787734
'It was a painful, but\nnot an improbable, conjecture.'	2.6884155511009205
'MY DEAR SIR,\n\n      I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation\n     in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now\n     suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter\n     from Hertfordshire.'	2.6892014218062297
'Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,  said she,\n did he come at all?'	2.689332686251736
"Mr\nCollins moreover adds,   I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad\nbusiness has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their\nliving together before the marriage took place, should be so generally\nknown."	2.689364518403997
'The introduction\nwas followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a\nreadiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the\nwhole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,\nwhen the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were\nseen riding down the street.'	2.689542407257019
'You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if I\nwent to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.'	2.69012509892021
'Mr Collins\nwas employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her\nfor every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.'	2.690299729507644
'As I must\ntherefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I\nshall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by\nsuspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.'	2.6910721825892194
'She saw the indelicacy of putting\nhimself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions\nwith his conduct.'	2.6912699361326373
'On this point she was\nsoon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they\nparted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of\nJane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that\nmight lead to the mention of her, had he dared.'	2.6914579256579585
'My dear Mr Bennet,  said his lady to him one day,  have you heard that\nNetherfield Park is let at last?'	2.6915040749792993
'Mr Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn\nwhen she was only eight years old.'	2.6915927223715896
"By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a\nwoman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not\nalways allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself."	2.691834153178907

'The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two\nyounger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin\nJane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and\nsweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every\nway--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.'	2.6956297448095876
'Smiles decked the face of Mr Bennet, as the carriage drove up to\nthe door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,\nanxious, uneasy.'	2.6957820068997003
'It seemed like wilful\nill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not\nmerely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he\nactually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.'	2.6958095239104747
'But it is so\nstrange!'	2.696622894354047
'There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at\nthe will of others.'	2.6967452929076123
'If therefore she\nactually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to\nforce her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of\ntemper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.'	2.6970484731747635

"In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth\ninstantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the\nvarious recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;\nbut, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\npresently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone."	2.6993617728135866

'Miss\nBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\nfirst opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,\n\n Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?'	2.702108630576714
'I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.'	2.7028098779451537
'It is a long time, Mr Bingley, since you went away,  said Mr Bennet.'	2.703487797908851
'She is a great\nreader and has no pleasure in anything else.'	2.703498294758619
'They look upon it\nquite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.'	2.703694728769291
'I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for I am fond of\nsuperior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of\nLondon would agree with Lady Lucas.'	2.7037779639421005
'It must be an amusing study.'	2.703810030548002
'it\nhad been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.'	2.70415499947181
'Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof\n     against the temptation of immediate relief.'	2.704359238557127
'Mr Gardiner himself\ndid not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was\neager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.'	2.7045290970072116
'How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so\ndesirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for\nhappiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own\nfamily!'	2.704589412539705
"In such an exigence my uncle's advice and\n     assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately\n     comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness."	2.704666637126476
'He begins with\ncongratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of\nwhich it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping\nLucases.'	2.705134168012936
'Can she be ignorant of what you\nand Jane seem so well to understand?'	2.7054460992772795
'A promise\nof secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept\nwithout difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst\nforth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some\ningenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great\nself-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.'	2.7056401693569776
'It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among\nher companions.'	2.7057930388063123
'But not long was the interval of\ntranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she\nhad the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\npreparing to oblige the company.'	2.7059129623232394
'She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through\nMeryton, thought she might as well call on you.'	2.7060415629046783
'Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how\nmuch he will give her.'	2.70619943863976
'When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mr Forster to Meryton,\nfrom whence they were to set out early the next morning.'	2.706425575408541
"Mr Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my\n     sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot\n     help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a\n     strong inducement."	2.7064965478158207
'Yes; but when questioned by  him  Denny denied knowing any thing of\ntheir plan, and would not give his real opinion about it.'	2.706907984106741
'You may depend upon it, Madam,  said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,\n that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she\nremains with us.'	2.7075304530799618
'Why was he to be the judge?'	2.7076774766685645
"It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that\nhis affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends\nsuccessfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's\nattractions."	2.707886276281217
'With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion\ncontinued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.'	2.708074071060119
'When Mr Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual\nphilosophic composure.'	2.7081195836880645
"Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force\none most reluctant smile."	2.7086450512396256
'Sure he\nwill not leave London before he has found them.'	2.7087249617631826
"Mr Gardiner gave her the\nparticulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street, and\nrepeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and\nherself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the\nacquaintance."	2.708751057877086
'Mr Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\npassing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too\nmuch engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas\nwas his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.'	2.709352912750906
'In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an\nhour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the\nopportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to\nsatisfy.'	2.7093967712963285
'If I may so express it, he has a  right \nto be proud.'	2.7100104992667178
'Only think what an establishment it would\nbe for one of them.'	2.7101922231509645
'Your \nretrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment\narising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of\nignorance.'	2.7103432946896473
'I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am\ngrowing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.'	2.7104898010673155
'The\nwisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions,\nmay be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a\njoke.'	2.710535103399895
'Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down\nagain to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.'	2.710762811453777
'Bingley was all grateful\npleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of\nwaiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to\ngo the next day for a short time.'	2.7108524951888
'how I laughed!'	2.7115057535822302
'Well, my dear,  said he, when she ceased speaking,  I have no more to\nsay.'	2.7126014754986825
'At last it\narrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr Darcy, with\nsuch a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,\nwhen he looked at her.'	2.7134753079067093
'And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but\ntell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them,\nafter they are married.'	2.7137583669951026
'As she went up stairs to get ready, Mr Bennet followed her,\nsaying,\n\n I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that\ndisagreeable man all to yourself.'	2.714151390757915
'The journey would moreover give her\na peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have\nbeen very sorry for any delay.'	2.7143035324198754
'I am\nperfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any\ndesign of engaging my affection.'	2.714369285822699
'I grieve to\n     find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their\n     marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he\n     feared W. was not a man to be trusted.'	2.7150169532009913
'My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for\nevery clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example\nof matrimony in his parish.'	2.7150517399782186
'Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing\nwhat she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the\nother, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows:'	2.7152744086278853
'Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for  us  to visit\nhim, if you do not.'	2.7152745057475824
'He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to\nentertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her\nthat all was safe, her wit flowed long.'	2.7152961366780146
'Mr\nHurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the\nsophas and go to sleep.'	2.7155869678517495
'Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your\nadvice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though\nin the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and\nhabitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like\nyourself.'	2.715806288358645
"CHAPTER XVI.\n\n\nInstead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as\nElizabeth half expected Mr Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy\nwith him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's\nvisit."	2.715925438584598
'It is only that he is blessed with\ngreater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally\npleasing than any other man.'	2.7159831033045942
'His debts are to be paid,\n     amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,\n     another thousand in addition to her own settled upon  her , and his\n     commission purchased.'	2.716480266073064
'Mr Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the\ndelightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of\nsettlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly\nsee her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four\nmonths.'	2.7169679545483323
'Can it be\npossible that he will marry her?'	2.717164373691147
'Lizzy,  said her father,  I have given him my consent.'	2.7174466637879355
"But Mr Bennet, who had calculated on\nher daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which\nwould exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive\nthem with pleasure before."	2.7174880647506603
"There were\nfew people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;\nbut at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's\nfrailty would have mortified her so much."	2.7175337915064426
"I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr Collins's\ncharacter, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my\nchance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on\nentering the marriage state."	2.71801401383049
'I never can be thankful, Mr Bennet, for any thing about the entail.'	2.7182448537508077
'We will go as far as Meryton with you,  said Catherine and\nLydia.--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set\noff together.'	2.718266100437023
'Imprudent as a marriage between Mr Wickham and our poor Lydia\n     would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for\n     there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.'	2.7183110071688423
'His coming into the country at all, is a\nmost insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.'	2.718526167490449
'That he was  surprised  by the\nconnexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so\nfar from going away, turned back with them, and entered into\nconversation with Mr Gardiner.'	2.7186873465361736
'Mr Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them\non her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by\nher communication.'	2.7193853156157433
'But you see that Jane,  said her aunt,  does not think so ill of\nWickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.'	2.7196819404734045
'He had to be sure done much.'	2.719733561779574
'The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and\nshopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.'	2.719929023185391
'And  that  I suppose is one of your sisters.'	2.720459675371875
'In every thing else she is as\ngood natured a girl as ever lived.'	2.720581443498106
"Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she\nwatched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience\nwhich was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving\namongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be\nprevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute\nbegan another."	2.7210868697605184
'I\nmust have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.'	2.7214062023787466
'The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a\nheadache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to\nher unwillingness to see Mr Darcy, it determined her not to attend her\ncousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.'	2.7219134624616474
'Mr Darcy!--and so it does I vow.'	2.7223784656523096
'The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them\npronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.'	2.722403343923618
'Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving\nhim the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and\nhypocrisy of my son-in-law.'	2.7225162653869255
'Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\nPemberley by purchase than by imitation.'	2.722559671394884
'MY DEAR BROTHER,\n\n      At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such\n     as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction.'	2.7227517591632475
'But if\notherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or\nunnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a\nfirst interview with its object, and even before two words have been\nexchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given\nsomewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,\nand that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other\nless interesting mode of attachment.'	2.7232022712015813
'They agree with me in\n     apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be\n     injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady\n     Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves\n     with such a family.'	2.723239613662468
'What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always\ncoming here?'	2.7233369363194915
'He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and\naffection of a sister.'	2.7234549620616058
'She followed him with\nher eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience\nenough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself\nfor being so silly!'	2.7234827586737285
"If you should have no objection to receive me\n     into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on\n     you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and\n     shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday\n     se'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as\n     Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a\n     Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the\n     duty of the day."	2.7235136645105036
'If there\nwere any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining\nsuch a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence.'	2.7237390207557506
'But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\nneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.'	2.723878363064889
'With all these circumstances to\nfavour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest\nJane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness\nof so many?'	2.724316995378138
'I know not in what manner, under what form of\n     falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to\n     be wondered at.'	2.7244694471402546
'Elizabeth saw directly that her\nfather had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were\nat the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often\ndisheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.'	2.724480758006964
'Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a\nslight inclination of the head.'	2.7246610530470003
'His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had\neither been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying\nhis vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most\nincautiously shewn.'	2.7250574612385856
"Bingley urged Mr Jones's being sent for\nimmediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could\nbe of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most\neminent physicians."	2.7255076235183995
'There was now an interest,\nhowever, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible,\nthat the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four\nyears old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be\nhastily rejected.'	2.725923533339147
'But he found, in reply to\n     this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more\n     effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.'	2.72623293128285
'But I am at his disposal.'	2.7265224188079227
'I am not indebted for my present happiness to\nyour eager desire of expressing your gratitude.'	2.726838299796251
'From\nwhat he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,\nreserved, disagreeable girl.'	2.7269596025443956
'No one but Jane, she thought,\ncould flatter herself with such an expectation.'	2.7270984556192537
'Family pride, and  filial  pride, for he is very proud of what\nhis father was, have done this.'	2.7271133530237504
"She was\ngoing to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on\nWednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be\nkilled."	2.7271646641782947
'She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the\ncard party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.'	2.727252246014181
'1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern\nwhat you can do with this work.'	2.7280765014654933
'Miss Lucas perceived\nhim from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly\nset out to meet him accidentally in the lane.'	2.7281647688852377
'But we are none\nof us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger\nimpulses even than pride.'	2.72831858028411
'But Mr Bennet was not of a\ndisposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own\nimprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often\nconsole the unfortunate for their folly or their vice.'	2.728438979342166
'Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did\nMr Bennet give up the point.'	2.728632131130308
'Upon my word,  said her Ladyship,  you give your opinion very\ndecidedly for so young a person.--Pray, what is your age?'	2.7286369115672384
'His circumstances, he\n     assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were\n     exceedingly bad.'	2.7286716757186538
'After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know\nany thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that\nit was time to be at home.'	2.7286830766754475
"And when I returned home, the ----shire\nwas to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time."	2.7287276669090037
'Every girl in, or near Meryton, was out of her senses about him\nfor the first two months; but he never distinguished  her  by any\nparticular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of\nextravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others\nof the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her\nfavourites.'	2.728818265129344
'The darling wish of his\nsisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county\nto Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source\nof happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.'	2.728865666957069
'But you are not entitled to know  mine ; nor will such behaviour as\nthis, ever induce me to be explicit.'	2.7288931851630247
'After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every\nvariety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities,\nand reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and\nso important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her\nat length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of\nappearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such\nreflections as must make her unfit for conversation.'	2.72937636402825
'Mr Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and\naffectionately taking her hand, said in reply,\n\n Do not make yourself uneasy, my love.'	2.729846644039745
'The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the\npreservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my\nopinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily\nchanged as that implies.'	2.7298834030381576
'Mr Hurst and Miss\nBingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who\ncontinued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined\ntheir party in the drawing-room.'	2.729886842127987
'It was consequently necessary to\nname some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have\nsome other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by\nagain enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the\npresent, and prepare for another disappointment.'	2.729908269314013
'Not that  I  think\nCharlotte so  very  plain--but then she is our particular friend.'	2.730203065048403
'I do not think we were speaking at all.'	2.7302264521142745
'You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates\nof my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look\non as a point of duty.'	2.7308663704458294
'My visit was\nnot long, as Caroline and Mr Hurst were going out.'	2.7313284222176497
'Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing\n     but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed\n     him to act as he has done.'	2.7318137196831502
'Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came\nfrom Netherfield, and was opened immediately.'	2.7323064932522336
'But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,  said Jane.'	2.7326120792766173
'They were certainly no friends to\nhis acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have\nchosen so much more advantageously in many respects.'	2.7328542810548835
'Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her\nuncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their\nfavourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.'	2.732909268094952
"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,  said Darcy in\na less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour."	2.733007354318437
'And who is there, whatever might be\ntheir former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,\ntill it were proved against them?'	2.7330380222905317
'She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all\nher chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.'	2.733048020603074
'After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a\nlively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr Darcy, drawing near\nElizabeth, said to her--\n\n Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an\nopportunity of dancing a reel?'	2.733052213666713
"She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in\nsilence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for\nin Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her,\nwhich soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against\nanother."	2.7330565016241692
'Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,  she added in a melancholy tone,\n for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used,\nnobody feels for my poor nerves.'	2.7334283033330578
'my dear,  said Maria quite shocked at the mistake,  it is not Lady\nCatherine.'	2.734167779277988
'But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his\ncharacter, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next\nmorning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw\nhimself at her feet.'	2.7343508438645885
'She was then but\n     fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her\n     imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to\n     herself.'	2.7344752841233047
'Though our kind\nuncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten\nthousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced.'	2.7346323175510427
"Lady Catherine had been rendered so\nexceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that\nCharlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till\nthe storm was blown over."	2.7352429879099915
'Do not you want to know who has taken it?'	2.735602564819688
'She was\nto accompany Sir William and his second daughter.'	2.7358337345753694
"Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and\nwithin four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr Gardiner's\nhouse, where they were to remain a few days."	2.7359343006120693
'I must confess myself\n     surprised by your application; I did not expect it from  you .'	2.735985641555591
'Almost as\nsoon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my\nfuture life.'	2.736006837970023
'Kitty and\nLydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr Collins was only a\nclergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news\nto spread at Meryton.'	2.7361290894686956
'His pride,  said Miss Lucas,  does not offend  me  so much as pride\noften does, because there is an excuse for it.'	2.7363512895511137
'Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,\nthat I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in\nmarriage.'	2.7364938188733823
'The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,\nabout a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.'	2.736534305833622
'Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no\ncompensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing\nhow much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her\nformer lover.'	2.736594802782856
'His\nfriend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in\nten days time.'	2.7370567296895167
'And even Mary could assure her family\nthat she had no disinclination for it.'	2.7376688548064014
'His pride, in that direction,\nmay be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter\nhim from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by.'	2.7381402062286324
'Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her\naffection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already\nself-destined to another.'	2.738454135774158
"It had come\nwith a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a\ngentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be\nremarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham."	2.738743837179051
'It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.'	2.7388403529744543
"She had high\nanimal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the\nattentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own\neasy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance."	2.739120094640534
'He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he\ncertainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,\nto counterbalance these advantages, Mr Darcy had considerable patronage\nin the church, and his cousin could have none at all.'	2.739522340935446
'She has the\nreputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe\nshe derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from\nher authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who\nchuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of\nthe first class.'	2.740523649399085
'These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have\nexperienced many hardships of that nature.'	2.7406193851841256
'She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and\ncambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had\nnot Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her\nfather was at leisure to be consulted.'	2.740718967971965
'The turn of your countenance I shall never\nforget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible\nway, that would induce you to accept me.'	2.741447534402903
'Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied\nwith believing that  she  would have been his only choice, had fortune\npermitted it.'	2.742074794351965
'I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get\nover it immediately.'	2.7423364271969595
'Not at all,  was her answer;  but depend upon it, he means to be severe\non us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing\nabout it.'	2.7423729570681976
'I am astonished,  said Miss Bingley,  that my father should have left\nso small a collection of books.--What a delightful library you have at\nPemberley, Mr Darcy!'	2.74251523099263
'Mr Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no\nmore, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account\nfor it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it\nwith less perplexity.'	2.7427486323669306
'Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was\nopened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for\nit.'	2.7429176896004837
'Miss Bennet was therefore\nestablished as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such\ncommendation to think of her as he chose.'	2.742947937684749
'She\nhad never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural\nbeauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.'	2.7434388723832117
'And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters\nbehind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the\nwinter is over.'	2.7439055659328973
'Allowing the case, however, to stand\naccording to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that\nthe friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the\ndelay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one\nargument in favour of its propriety.'	2.7442159622193305
'The principal\npurport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr Wickham had resolved\non quitting the Militia.'	2.7442364547939735
'I comfort myself with thinking,  replied Jane,  that he certainly would\nnot marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her.'	2.7447346175774436
"Regard for my sister's credit and feelings\n     prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr Wickham, who left\n     the place immediately, and Mr Younge was of course removed from\n     her charge."	2.744829004172145
'CHAPTER XXIII.\n\n\nElizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what\nshe had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it,\nwhen Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to\nannounce her engagement to the family.'	2.7450253219183423
"Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and\nElizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid\nher anxiety had done no good.--Others of the party were now applied to."	2.7454190953642628
'Jane, I take your place now, and you must go\nlower, because I am a married woman.'	2.7455876859131205
'What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the\nproposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now\nhave been gladly and gratefully received!'	2.745618341788398
'for I dare not hope,  he continued in a lower and more\nserious tone,  that he is improved in essentials.'	2.745622765575268
'Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of\nhis situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not\nvery fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone\nso material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make\nher receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances.'	2.746192371969622
'Mr Collins and Charlotte appeared at\nthe door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a\nshort gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole\nparty.'	2.746213612099609
"You either chuse this method of passing\nthe evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret\naffairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures\nappear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, I should be\ncompletely in your way;--and if the second, I can admire you much better\nas I sit by the fire."	2.7471709411585863
'I am only distressed by\nsome dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.'	2.747438694204682
"For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more\n     particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our\n     near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of\n     the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted\n     with every particular of these transactions."	2.747515487885966
'The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was\nsaid of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on\nJane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred.'	2.748168105594432
'Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a\nprivate conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.'	2.7482393554161466
'He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any\none, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and\nhe was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his\nassistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.'	2.7486876767144905
'At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mr Hurst and\nElizabeth herself.'	2.7496572391691965
"Anxiety on Jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr\nDarcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good\nopinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost."	2.7499363579601246
'He is certainly a good brother,  said Elizabeth, as she walked towards\none of the windows.'	2.7499710725417024
'Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be\nnear so much like a ball.'	2.7499914851981244
'This is not quite\nenough to make her understand his character.'	2.750217478682966
'He generously imputed the whole to his\n     mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath\n     him, to lay his private actions open to the world.'	2.7504505677665505
'Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid\nwhether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its\nproprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for\nthe summer.'	2.750796214821947
'You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?'	2.751356416303177
'Supposing him to be attached to\nme, would  my  refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it\non his cousin?'	2.7516430388029596
'I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or\nother, and not disturb us with his company.'	2.751879914239831
'The conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr Darcy\ninvite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he\nchose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same\ntime to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\nthe stream where there was usually most sport.'	2.7520604719390853
"This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by\nElizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for\nWickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling\nof displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate\ndisappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to\nthe polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to\nmake.--Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to\nWickham."	2.752881155220124
'Do not give way to useless alarm,  added he,  though it is right to be\nprepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.'	2.7528932886902133
'I was sure you could not\nbe so beautiful for nothing!'	2.753465968411142
'You have\nwithheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for\nhim.'	2.7540856222925143
'They are gone down to\nNewcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to\nstay, I do not know how long.'	2.7541313036630095
'We have reason to imagine\nthat his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with\na friendly eye.'	2.754349574913177
'Elizabeth received her\ncongratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took\nrefuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.'	2.75484624365091
'Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led\nvoluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for\nthe world.'	2.755266216423446
'Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant\na situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by\nmentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and\nendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,\nby the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she\nwas readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the\nhappiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character\nof Mr Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.'	2.755802585894942
"The arrival of letters was\nthe first grand object of every morning's impatience."	2.75595678177452
'I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows\nhim,  replied the other.'	2.7559920470858508
'At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with\nnews and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the\nneighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the\nhead quarters.'	2.7562304626612417
'To persuade him against\n     returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,\n     was scarcely the work of a moment.--I cannot blame myself for\n     having done thus much.'	2.756443334951308
'Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards\ntook occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,\nwhether  all  her sisters were at Longbourn.'	2.756525347491835
'I\nhad hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must\nso far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly\nfoolish.'	2.757049113410815
'But of course she did not mention my name to you.'	2.7581454131485503
'I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that,\nhad you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have\nacknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.'	2.7582384373705353
'There has\nbeen many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.'	2.7584356997352226
'On this subject, what can you have to\nsay?'	2.758893634446428
'She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.'	2.7594040890658382
'Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed,  To\ntreat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his\nfather!'	2.759789015063825
'She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening\nwith an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.'	2.759967965010607
'I will not be interrupted.'	2.7603826370856446
'The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had\ngiven him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good\ndeal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in\nretirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected\nprosperity.'	2.761114206884428
'Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,  added\nCharlotte,  and a most attentive neighbour.'	2.761404988546263
'It is impossible that he should still love\nme.'	2.761668721257636
'Mr Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked\nher, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.'	2.7630975175046215
'On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very\npretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and\nlightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but\njust done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the\nroom, when last at Pemberley.'	2.7631451295812006
'CHAPTER II.\n\n\nAfter a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr\nCollins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of\nSaturday.'	2.763188420756109
'Conceal the unhappy truth as\nlong as it is possible.--I know it cannot be long.'	2.7632830581094154
'I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just\nsaid, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.'	2.763646137630935
'Elizabeth however did not chuse to\ntake the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\nconsequence of any reply.'	2.7637288078448248
'It will be  her  turn soon to be teazed,  said Miss Lucas.'	2.7642188566069406
"When Mr Collins could be\nforgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by\nCharlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often\nforgotten."	2.764649627303056
'But though Bingley and Jane\nmeet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they\nalways see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that\nevery moment should be employed in conversing together.'	2.764935831570063
'Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\nwaiting-woman was in it.'	2.7651175526860774
'Though he had\ndetected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry\nin her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and\npleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those\nof the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.'	2.7651513876901688
'And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a\ndoubt, I suppose, of their being really married?'	2.7659745647918896
'Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their\nconversation, which had been passing while Mr and Mr Gardiner were\nengaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of\nthe whole party.'	2.7661629592817167
'Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the\ngentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.'	2.766321480147279
'She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery\n     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be\n     found.'	2.7663746793276838
'He could not help\nseeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in\nthe room.'	2.766645795299834
'Elizabeth\nhad hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did\nnot appear in the least affected by it.'	2.7666679072452105
'Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the\ncase?'	2.767092753816495
'He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,\n     and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would\n     be a very insufficient support therein.'	2.767383547375776
'All that is known after this is, that they were seen\n     to continue the London road.'	2.7674692674430177
'When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,\nthe tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mr Collins,\ngratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.'	2.7678081343488463
'Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice\nof what might be called economy in her own private expences, she\nfrequently sent them.'	2.7681753592105163
'The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost\ncontempt.'	2.7681826743961455
'She had even condescended to advise him to\nmarry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had\nonce paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly\napproved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed\nto suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.'	2.7682594794110877
"On being made acquainted with the\npresent Mr Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of\nthat gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree\nwith it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard\nMr Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured\nboy."	2.7682973774040107
'When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.'	2.7688719982904875
'She\ncould not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her\nquestion, and read on.'	2.7691540822840754
'Having thus\noffered you the sincere congratulations of Mr Collins and myself on\nthis happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another:'	2.769300971433464
'Mr Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said,   You  cannot\nhave a right to such very strong local attachment.'	2.769476936323163
'But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she\nsaw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother\nhad been too ingenious for her.'	2.7695796218900366
'He resigned all\n     claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could\n     ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three\n     thousand pounds.'	2.7708350690627084
'Mr Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as\nsoon as they were gone Mr Collins began.'	2.771529257912852
'Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade\nin Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the\nhonour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty.'	2.771601320901252
'We must not be so ready to fancy\nourselves intentionally injured.'	2.771704186051016
'If he did\nshrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.'	2.7720616802194606
'Mr Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a\nletter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately\nfound out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street.'	2.7720906310215905
"She saw her in idea settled in\nthat very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection\ncould bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of\nendeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters."	2.7728431620155676
'I have been used to consider poetry as the  food  of love,  said Darcy.'	2.7729001736660823
'But the morrow\npassed off much better than she expected; for Mr Bennet luckily stood\nin such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak\nto him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark\nher deference for his opinion.'	2.773062535335005
'As yet, she\ncannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its\nreasonableness.'	2.77392274216943
'You know not, you\ncan scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some\ntime, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.'	2.7743500249820956
'As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and\nshook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;\nand he soon afterwards said aloud,  Mr Bennet, have you no more lanes\nhereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?'	2.774369717445118
'Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any\none; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived\nherself.'	2.774406407268164
'And then, you know, when once they get\ntogether, there is no end of it.'	2.7747805262360927
"The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had\nproduced of what Mr Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's\nmatch, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too\ngreat to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the\npain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!"	2.775350530453037
'Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said\nless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;\nnor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.'	2.775992041544006
'While I can have my mornings to myself,  said she,  it is enough.--I\nthink it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.'	2.7760892018175336
'By many significant looks and silent\nentreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of\ncomplaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an\nopportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.'	2.7764289044838946
'They could\nhave been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the\nsame.'	2.776757736706659
'My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which\nmeans my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.'	2.7770260814934637
'That is the most unforgiving speech,  said Elizabeth,  that I ever\nheard you utter.'	2.7770502389004372
'The\nrector of a parish has much to do.--In the first place, he must make\nsuch an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not\noffensive to his patron.'	2.778201341129333
"As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it\ntaken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"	2.778438252925957
'Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with\nmuch more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the\nend of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by\nScotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with\nsome of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing\nat one end of the room.'	2.7784892935413694
"She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had\na few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever\nprevailed on to get out."	2.7785850793682023
'But to be sure,\nthe good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming\ncharacter!'	2.7786146542788224
'After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not\nhelp reverting once more to the first, and saying,\n\n I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr Bingley!'	2.7786809364654697
'I am thinking of what you have been telling me,  said she.'	2.7788296514414252
'Mr Bennet, through the assistance of servants,\ncontrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety\nand fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could.'	2.7789831343304265
"She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to\nshare with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a\nfamily so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and\nrequiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing\ncould be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost\nimportance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience\nwas severe."	2.7792822843850775
"You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,'\nthat you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always\ndelight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of\ntheir premeditated contempt."	2.7799291299185693
'Mr Bennet\nwondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much\ntrouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again.--But their\nfather, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really\nglad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.'	2.780011444787561
'It is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them\n     both---- \n\n Then it is, as I always hoped,  cried Jane;  they are married!'	2.7802413444111265
'This is not\nthe sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his\nwife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true\nphilosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.'	2.780305268358819
'The rest of the evening passed with the  appearance , on his side,\nof usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish\nElizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a\nmutual desire of never meeting again.'	2.7804363831889716
'He is rich, to be\nsure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.'	2.780522696819658
"My brother admires her greatly already, he will have\nfrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her\nrelations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's\npartiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most\ncapable of engaging any woman's heart."	2.7808138462119008
'Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach\nof her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her\nbetter satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.'	2.78081989275751
"Mr Darcy may\nperhaps have  heard  of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would\nhardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its\nimpurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr Bingley\nnever stirs without him."	2.7808639216756763
'Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we\nmay laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.'	2.7809960747676796
'Not that I mean to find fault with  you , for such things\nI know are all chance in this world.'	2.781264976993945
'Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed\nthe bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mr Gardiner,\nwho was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of\nreturning to the carriage as quickly as possible.'	2.781310155925185
'On the evening before my going to London,  said he  I made a confession\nto him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.'	2.7813455111246017
'Such a circumstance could only\nexasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her\ncheeks, and she said,\n\n In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\nexpress a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however\nunequally they may be returned.'	2.7814767891532175
'I was only confused for the moment, because I felt\nthat I  should  be looked at.'	2.7820617288196834
'She danced four\ndances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,\nand has since dined in company with him four times.'	2.7824206787523735
'Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though\nher resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such\ndisapprobation.'	2.782427762558846
'By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried\n     letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not\n     confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer\n     for being coherent.'	2.782956367510979
'It was to be such a secret!'	2.7835292168988564
'His regiment is there; for I suppose you\nhave heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the\nregulars.'	2.784199276015084
'As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner\nin which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to\ngive them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other\ngot pretty near the truth.'	2.7843335123057305
'Thank you,  said Lydia,  for if you did, I should certainly tell you\nall, and then Wickham would be angry.'	2.7846547523149194
'The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mr Forster,\nthe delight of Mr Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely\nto be described.'	2.7851358254440997
'I did not know before,  continued Bingley immediately,  that you were a\nstudier of character.'	2.785274625233186
'His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she\ncould not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or\nfeel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.'	2.7857352057413634
'There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just\nenough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting\nabout pretty much.'	2.7857409357727487
"Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a\nwelcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mr Collins's pretty friend had\nmoreover caught his fancy very much."	2.785833309929847
'He did look at it and into it for half an\nhour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied\nwith what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.'	2.7860943339362385
'She saw that he wanted to engage her on\nthe old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge\nhim.'	2.7862545203984714
'He really\nbelieved, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he\nshould be in some danger.'	2.7865845863679484
'Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her\nfeatures, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very\nlittle, except in a low voice, to Mr Jenkinson, in whose appearance\nthere was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening\nto what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\nher eyes.'	2.7867115222189867
"From his garden, Mr Collins would have led them round his two meadows,\nbut the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white\nfrost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte\ntook her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,\nprobably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's\nhelp."	2.7868286591180933
'Mr Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly\nsuperior to his sister, as well by nature as education.'	2.7882371085786066
'Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never\nbe over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt\nwere horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them.'	2.788390251982992
'I\nassure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an\nagreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.'	2.7886367774585277
'Mr Bennet could not give her consent, or\nspeak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,\nthough she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when\nMr Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed\nhow really happy he was.'	2.7889225822475354
'It is\nwonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that\nway.'	2.7893693288198174
'Elizabeth\nwas not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and\npleased.'	2.789730535992434
'pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for\nthere is such a sight to be seen!'	2.790626850473481
'Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from\nCharlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.'	2.7911542153804825
'He was her dear Wickham on every\noccasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.'	2.791456531165458
'Her astonishment at his coming--at his\ncoming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,\nwas almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered\nbehaviour in Derbyshire.'	2.7918672867535848
'She follows him to\ntown in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he\ndoes not care about you.'	2.7919077821857257
'I am not afraid of you,  said he, smilingly.'	2.792434841488572
'But if you are really innocent and\n     ignorant, I must be more explicit.'	2.792464744550902
'Mr Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment\nof her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family\ndinner.'	2.7931011111863304
'indeed, nobody\ncan, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\ndown the dance.'	2.7931954766622242
'But\nof all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom\ncould boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings,\nafforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly\nopposite the front of his house.'	2.7934552283734293
'We have judged it best, that my\n     niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will\n     approve.'	2.7936157980678806
'I thank you\nagain and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but\nto accept them is absolutely impossible.'	2.793635676609223
'Her niece was,\ntherefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\non the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\nprogress was slow, for Mr Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\ntaste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the\noccasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man\nabout them, that he advanced but little.'	2.793744730695749
'Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr\nCollins first came to Hunsford.'	2.7939316789626263
'When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth\nfor the indulgence of some music.'	2.794090829283563
"Lydia was\noccasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself\nin London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently\nstaid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he\nproceeded so far as to  talk  of giving them a hint to be gone."	2.7945068921478873
"But it ended in\nnothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again."	2.7957187046951515
'Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but\nLydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,\ndetained first by the civility of Mr Collins, whose inquiries after\nherself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little\ncuriosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending\nnot to hear.'	2.7957386323300213
'Mr Darcy asked him why he had not married your\n     sister at once.'	2.796205725668082
'But I can assure you,  she added,  that Lizzy does not lose much by not\nsuiting  his  fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at\nall worth pleasing.'	2.796243441694611
'What you ask,  said Elizabeth,  is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr\nDarcy had much better finish his letter.'	2.796292108050802
'No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely\nresolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more\nnecessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\nsaw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\nand that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\nwhen he first came into the room.'	2.7964792558126064
'You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!'	2.7967635768393744
"He stood by her, however, for\nsome minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering\nto Elizabeth again, he walked away."	2.7967794764815155
'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last\nnight, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she\nfelt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some\nfamily objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her\nconsent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.'	2.7971782117079735
'But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the\ngood-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from\nall the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit\nin this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her\nmisery was considered certain.'	2.7972166237427345
'I can readily believe,  answered he gravely,  that report may vary\ngreatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were\nnot to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to\nfear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.'	2.7972454721416655
'But it is not merely this affair,  she continued,  on which my dislike\nis founded.'	2.7973490248568633
'And tell my dear\nLydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen\nme, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.'	2.7974438556191576
'You judge very properly,  said Mr Bennet,  and it is happy for you\nthat you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.'	2.79761525199427
'Let me advise you then, my dear Sir,\n     to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy\n     child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the\n     fruits of her own heinous offence.'	2.7978042394009606
'On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the\nhall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to\nwonder at her being where she was.'	2.7978291622102627
'We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us,  said Mr\nGardiner,  but perhaps to the Lakes.'	2.798114796380992
'But I am very\nfar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.'	2.7982255342902556
'Very little was said by either; Kitty was\ntoo much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a\ndesperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.'	2.7983922349912813
'She is so fond of Mr Forster,  said she,  it will be quite shocking\nto send her away!'	2.7984637035226383
'That is right.--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you\nwill not take comfort in mine.'	2.798721569433391
'It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you\nmust confess.'	2.7990826811573446
'Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious\npart of each was when the post was expected.'	2.7991223973451875
'She had\nspent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with\nCharlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make  her \nfeel the obliged.'	2.799791728915366
'Mr Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,\nis he?--Poor Eliza!--to be only just  tolerable .'	2.8000764741307327
'The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to\n     say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are\n     discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.'	2.8006707048299915
'My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour\nto  you  was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke\nto you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.'	2.8011095674236324
"CHAPTER XIX.\n\n\nHad Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could\nnot have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic\ncomfort."	2.8012331295113073
'I appeal to Mr Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,\nSir.--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching\nconverse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.'	2.8012399621185358
'CHAPTER II.\n\n\nMr Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr Bingley.'	2.80147928708183
'She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to\nher, cried in a half whisper,  I am glad you are come, for there is such\nfun here!--What do you think has happened this morning?--Mr Collins has\nmade an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.'	2.801849488104273
'Mr Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained\nwonder, and when at last Mr Collins allowed him time to speak, replied\nwith an air of distant civility.'	2.8020856138849486
'This is delightful indeed!--She will\nbe married!--I shall see her again!--She will be married at sixteen!--My\ngood, kind brother!--I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage\nevery thing.'	2.8021575533132905
'Every thing was too recent for\ngaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any\nthing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity\nwould come in time.'	2.8027218991325187
'The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of\nher wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of\naccomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those\nattendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and\nservants.'	2.8029000391203254
'Upon my word I say no more  here  than I might say in any house in the\nneighbourhood, except Netherfield.'	2.8029576069481394
'You look pale.'	2.8029586094632424
"Wickham's affection for Lydia, was just what Elizabeth had expected to\nfind it; not equal to Lydia's for him."	2.8031448451544128
'Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of\nthe letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the\nwriter, that could give her any comfort.'	2.8033739598348055
'CHAPTER XIV.\n\n\nThe two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr Collins having\nbeen in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was\nable to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very\ngood health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the\nmelancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings.'	2.8038767572036862
'In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her\nfather had been short and to the purpose.'	2.8042238772055827
'But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly\nshe went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.'	2.804375702714253
"She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady\nCatherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter\nCharlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room."	2.804533977155063
'Elizabeth\nnoticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an\nattention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.'	2.8046827170728568
'Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her\nladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.'	2.805101594771288
'But may we not\nhope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks\nforward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful\nintercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater\nsatisfaction as sisters?--Mr Bingley will not be detained in London by\nthem.'	2.8055529542010205
'I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have\n     done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but\n     to say the truth, I was too cross to write.'	2.805943990576461
"This was\nvery amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth\nhad any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her\nfrom any return of Mr Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards\nherself."	2.8059759501258723
'Lady\nCatherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to\nBingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.'	2.8060886026006924
'The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly\nfor denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as\nhaving passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first\ndisapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind\nthan on hers.'	2.806230655646347
'But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,\nwhere one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no\nvery great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying\nwith the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?'	2.806496418968954
'She was on the point of continuing her walk,\nwhen she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which\nedged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr\nDarcy, she was directly retreating.'	2.8065198548403547
'At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind\nroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.'	2.8065347595363237
'Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.'	2.8068005096989217
'Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and\nsuch realities as these, what would have been her sensations?'	2.807329913515676
'I will take care of\nmyself, and of Mr Wickham too.'	2.8075125317547838
'His sense of her inferiority--of\nits being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had\nalways opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed\ndue to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to\nrecommend his suit.'	2.8075453438702964
"But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained\nin any doubt of your sister's sentiments."	2.807575677666607
'She could only imagine however\nat last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about\nher more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than\nin any other person present.'	2.8078151083048515
'But before I am run away with by my feelings on this\nsubject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for\nmarrying--and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of\nselecting a wife, as I certainly did.'	2.8079150808923035
'Through letters,\nwhatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every\nsucceeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.'	2.8080223181359747
"If you'll believe\nme, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a\nfortnight."	2.808238794291083
'Without a governess you must\nhave been neglected.'	2.8084737031397995
'Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the\nunexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in\na tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.'	2.8087264596498693
'But when they had withdrawn, he said to her,  Mr\nBennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and\ndaughter, let us come to a right understanding.'	2.8091877848865883
'Miss Bingley was\nengrossed by Mr Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr\nHurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to\neat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish\nto a ragout, had nothing to say to her.'	2.809262737548587
'At Brighton she will be of less importance\neven as a common flirt than she has been here.'	2.8093651665424386
"The\nhall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised;\nand his commendation of every thing would have touched Mr Bennet's\nheart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his\nown future property."	2.809453490930666
'Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people\nin whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\nfelt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or\npleasure.'	2.8095521099217144
'For\n     about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the\n     incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied\n     to me again by letter for the presentation.'	2.81030374563393
'Mr Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been\ndistinguished by his sisters.'	2.8107242702324093
'Elizabeth\nsmiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.'	2.8108147546057496
'It is settled between us already, that\nwe are to be the happiest couple in the world.'	2.810861494730747
'A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side\ncalm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte\nand her sister, just returned from their walk.'	2.810997648584937
'I would advise you merely to put on\nwhatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion\nfor any thing more.'	2.8114689696395354
'that I had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety\nupon yourself alone.'	2.811825260519413
"I remember the time when I\nliked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so I do still at my heart;\nand if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should\nwant one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel\nForster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his\nregimentals."	2.8118399192377153
"She\ncould think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really\ndied away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he\nhad been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his\nobservation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be\nmaterially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained\nthe same, her peace equally wounded."	2.8121105346033595
'Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.'	2.812621413011989
'You may readily comprehend,  she added,  what my curiosity must be to\nknow how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively\nspeaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such\na time.'	2.8127979552063604
'The bride and her mother could neither\nof them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near\nElizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,\nwith a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her\nreplies.'	2.8133379508532825
"For your\nsake,  turning to Charlotte,  I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no\noccasion for entailing estates from the female line.--It was not thought\nnecessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family.--Do you play and sing, Miss\nBennet?"	2.8135405280083408
'His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the\ncompliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an\noccasion of introducing him to her father and mother.'	2.813564607392182
'When I wrote that letter,  replied Darcy,  I believed myself perfectly\ncalm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a\ndreadful bitterness of spirit.'	2.8138884598785756
'And then,  said she,  if that very\nimprobable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell\nwhat Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.'	2.813894981279104
'When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,\nthey returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were\nconsigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.'	2.813941161795605
"When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment\nshe soon found some resemblance of Mr Darcy, she turned her eyes on the\ndaughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment, at her\nbeing so thin, and so small."	2.814162457228052
'Lady Catherine herself says\nthat in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the\nhandsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks\nthe young woman of distinguished birth.'	2.8144275263716354
'CHAPTER XIV.\n\n\nDuring dinner, Mr Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants\nwere withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his\nguest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to\nshine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.'	2.814571222549087
"CHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage,\nand the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of\ntheir engagements at Rosings."	2.8146072337263517
"The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir\nWilliam's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his\neyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and\nJane, who were dancing together."	2.814757025946976
'He was too happy, however, to need much attention;\nand luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them\nfrom a great deal of his company.'	2.8148902250219843
"It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of\nMiss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as\nmade her look handsomer than ever."	2.814982482026824
"She examined into their employments, looked at their work,\nand advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement\nof the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she\naccepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding\nout that Mr Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family."	2.8150343195694734
'Thus much for my general\nintention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\nwere directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I\nassure you there are many amiable young women.'	2.8150682032615566
'Every disposition of the ground was\ngood; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered\non its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace\nit, with delight.'	2.8151174304463744
'I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will\nnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.'	2.815268415311248
'Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her\nimmediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving\nalarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed\nfor such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.'	2.8152745611665746
'He had ruined for a\nwhile every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart\nin the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have\ninflicted.'	2.815302053948674
'cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat\nas she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a\nmoment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was\nopened by a servant, and Mr Darcy appeared.'	2.8153383544227517
'We live in so different a part of\ntown, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go\nout so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,\nunless he really comes to see her.'	2.815357725404874
'About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready\nfor a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in\nconfusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up\nstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.'	2.8154645659986093
'I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.'	2.8155742685017935
'The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received\nfrom Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,\nif not by himself, such a hope was cherished.'	2.815697657171662
'For such an attachment\nas this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not\nsuppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the\nintention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither\nher virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy\nprey.'	2.8166082166589566
'Indeed,  replied Elizabeth,  I am heartily sorry for him; but he has\nother feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.'	2.816848697554437
'Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and\nthat it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.'	2.8168862579316714
'My avowed one, or what I avowed to\nmyself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,\nand if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.'	2.8168987233240093
'Well girls,  said she, as soon as they were left to themselves,  What\nsay you to the day?'	2.8171022300107977
"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,  replied Elizabeth, with\ntears in her eyes,  that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such\na point should admit of doubt."	2.817259111140606
'If Mr Darcy is neither by\nhonour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make\nanother choice?'	2.8175311803526903
'To all the\nobjections I have already urged, I have still another to add.'	2.818087638520186
"Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;\nand Mr Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and\nrings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss\nBennet."	2.8187598203050834
"Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after\nhalf an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join\nthe others with tolerable composure."	2.8188719906648814
'But the person who advanced, was now\nnear enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced\nher name.'	2.819029564424718
'But at last your uncle was forced\n     to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,\n     was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,\n     which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your\n     letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an\n     explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give\n     the praise where it was due.'	2.819044594643509
'Do you not know that such a\nreport is spread abroad?'	2.8190696380040197
'I wish you had been there, my\ndear, to have given him one of your set downs.'	2.8190808788718185
'I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling\n     myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both,\n     cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation,\n     and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been\n     spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.'	2.81909382002187
'My situation in life, my connections\nwith the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are\ncircumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther\nconsideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no\nmeans certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.'	2.8191771999987165
'She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a\nprudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.'	2.8192529392582713
'Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to\njoin with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but\nElizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention\neven from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,\nthan a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs.'	2.8194560558718855
'It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there\nten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it\nseemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to\npropriety, not a pleasure to himself.'	2.820014067507227
'It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the\nequipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.'	2.8200559757303707
'Jane was as much gratified by this, as her\nmother could be, though in a quieter way.'	2.820102100110178
"To Mr Bennet's\nacknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to\npromote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties\nthat the subject might never be mentioned to him again."	2.8201467369592126
'You must decide for yourself,  said Elizabeth,  and if upon mature\ndeliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is\nmore than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by\nall means to refuse him.'	2.82031435628665
'She had only to say in\nreply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own\nknowledge.'	2.820371796634396
'In\nterms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though\nexpressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\napprobation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\nengagements that had been made for him.'	2.8208126406928304
'But when they see,\nas I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will\nlearn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we\ncan never be what we once were to each other.'	2.8209538167217856
'He\n     meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future\n     situation, he could conjecture very little about it.'	2.8209631069398275
'Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their\nvisitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he\nturned to his daughter and said,\n\n Jane, I congratulate you.'	2.8213583667823414
'Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\ninsensibility.'	2.8214293325934494
'I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by\nhis coming.'	2.8214927084073995
'Mr Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not\nreturn it.'	2.8217449355074127
'He has also  brotherly  pride,\nwhich with  some  brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful\nguardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the\nmost attentive and best of brothers.'	2.821748817359527
'Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to\nColonel Fitzwilliam,  Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of\nme, and teach you not to believe a word I say.'	2.821930451007388
"Had Lydia's marriage been\nconcluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that\nMr Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other\nobjection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the\nnearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned."	2.8220052217391096
'I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind\nof elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.'	2.8228377675757637
'I would not on any\naccount trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it\nfrom any one but myself.'	2.822881784444106
'And this is always the way with him,  she added.-- Whatever\ncan give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment.'	2.823272183760753
'This son was to join\nin cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow\nand younger children would by that means be provided for.'	2.8236550671567473
"CHAPTER V.\n\n\nEvery object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to\nElizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had\nseen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,\nand the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight."	2.8237132953461868
'But I have always observed, that they who are\ngood-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he\nwas always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the\nworld.'	2.8238170643721614
'said she.'	2.824301479449371
'said she.'	2.824301479449371
'said she.'	2.824301479449371
'My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I\nconfess that I did not expect to receive  more  than my due.'	2.8247031530653866
'Mr Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching\nthe progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by\nmessages to his sister.'	2.8248916537376796
'My aunt Philips came to Longbourn\non Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till\nThursday with me.'	2.824952899436933
"To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was\npossible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her\nbrother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish\nwhich Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\nhereafter her own."	2.8251692569732074
'Mr Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal\npeople in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,\nwas angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one\nhimself at Netherfield.'	2.8256435016664647
'This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure, \nsaid he.'	2.8256721465281562
'I cannot be\n     otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your\n     amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to\n     assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but\n     of this hereafter.'	2.826208629581877
'There was\nnovelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such\nuncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change\nwas not unwelcome for its own sake.'	2.827181714446708
'On that head,\ntherefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that\nno ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.'	2.827281229509267
'I do not pretend to\nregret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my\ndearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many\nreturns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean\nwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most\nunreserved correspondence.'	2.8280625208122423
'If it was to be secret,  said Jane,  say not another word on the\nsubject.'	2.828079634655225
"If I wished to think slightingly\nof any body's children, it should not be of my own however."	2.82814020004943
"She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation\nbetween Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr Philips's."	2.8291611138921344
'My object  then ,  replied Darcy,  was to shew you, by every civility\nin my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped\nto obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you\nsee that your reproofs had been attended to.'	2.8296048863566674
"I have not been used to submit to any person's whims."	2.829626746818365
'I have been making the tour of the Park,  he replied,  as I generally\ndo every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage.'	2.829728402038996
'It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his\nreason.'	2.8300137642047414
'She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle\nand frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.'	2.830259043573719
'But she is nothing to me now.'	2.830369659109575
"They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr\nBingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their\nmother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of\nan ensign."	2.830930944928123
"There could be no conversation in the noise of\nMr Philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every\nbody."	2.831199722926121
'Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last\nKitty did, she very innocently said,  What is the matter mamma?'	2.8313426802753634
"One day's delay she observed,\nwould be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite\nso obstinate as usual."	2.831527919048558
'Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,\nhe really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of  my  being\nindifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!'	2.831695431245712
'She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far\nas they concerned George Wickham.'	2.8318919090578034
'But, \nshe continued, recollecting herself,  as we know none of the\nparticulars, it is not fair to condemn him.'	2.833196310803734
"In ran Mr Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing\ngown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,\n\n My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down."	2.8336212195236676
'While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the\ndoor bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its\nbeing Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in\nthe evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her.'	2.833628325668665
'How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions\nin speaking of Wickham to Mr Darcy, for now they  do  appear wholly\nundeserved.'	2.8336290531902097
'I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;\nor me either, for that matter.'	2.83375403224704
'At our time of life, it is not so\npleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but\nfor your sakes, we would do any thing.'	2.8339799467750586
'I wish you very happy and very rich, and by\nrefusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.'	2.834037351251588
'Nobody can tell what I\nsuffer!--But it is always so.'	2.8340934636284967
'The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;\nand, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card\ntable in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of\nthe first.'	2.83425387676409
'I advise Mr Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,  said Mr Bennet,  to walk\nto Oakham Mount this morning.'	2.834444613233984
'He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his\nintrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to\nbe within.'	2.8347761746178795
'Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.-- I assure\nyou, I feel it exceedingly,  said Lady Catherine;  I believe nobody\nfeels the loss of friends so much as I do.'	2.834911778809903
'For my part, I am determined never to speak\nof it again to anybody.'	2.834930607873787
'And of this place,  thought she,  I might have been mistress!'	2.835156145497275
'Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their\ncorrespondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it\nshould be equally unreserved was impossible.'	2.836172789946546
'Mr Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes\nconversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with\ntears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous\nconduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage;\nblaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the\nerrors of her daughter must be principally owing.'	2.836936635931568
"I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention;\nthe other is Charlotte's marriage."	2.837057157894777
"Elizabeth made no\nanswer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which\nshe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr Darcy, and\nreading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it."	2.837286111599378
"The strangeness of Mr Collins's making two offers\nof marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being\nnow accepted."	2.8373441103202666
"In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's\nwords, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible\nwhisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the\nchief of it was overheard by Mr Darcy, who sat opposite to them."	2.837397419916634
"Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer\nabove-mentioned; and while Mr Darcy was attending them to their\ncarriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on\nElizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress."	2.8374855399533003
'dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain.'	2.8376172338864207
'At such a distance as  that , you know, things are strangely\nmisrepresented.'	2.838556056801327
'If they believed him attached to me, they would not try\nto part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.'	2.8386395126860577
'How near it may be to  mine , I cannot pretend to say.-- You \nthink it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.'	2.8387448400740554
"It will be in my power to\nassure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night."	2.8387592981864547
'In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your\nfeelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\nestate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.'	2.838823514863594
"But amidst\n     your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your\n     displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you\n     consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to\n     avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally\n     bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to\n     the sense and disposition of both.--I will only say farther, that\n     from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was\n     confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me\n     before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy\n     connection.--He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,\n     as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon\n     returning.--The part which I acted, is now to be explained.--His\n     sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our\n     coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible\n     that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly\n     resolved on joining him directly in London.--We accordingly\n     went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to\n     my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--I described, and\n     enforced them earnestly.--But, however this remonstrance might have\n     staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it\n     would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been\n     seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your\n     sister's indifference."	2.838913155974884
'You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but\nwhich I have never acknowledged.'	2.8390804848255975
'The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she\nshould suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to\nthe other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the\ndoor.'	2.839080623274308
'He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again\n     on Wednesday or Thursday.'	2.8400048909974633
'They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to\nhave their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as\npossible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your\nlife.'	2.8400760579819657
"It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should\nform such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or\nfriendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I\nam strongly inclined to hope the best."	2.840240732852718
'But do you think she\nwould be prevailed on to go back with us?'	2.8407290295128655
'I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when\nyour sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of\nthe ball.'	2.840781385402296
'I did not know before, that I had  two  daughters on the brink\nof matrimony.'	2.840934474166233
'The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia,\ndepended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though\nthey each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr\nWickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and\na ball was at any rate, a ball.'	2.8409696640395894
'It taught me to hope,  said he,  as I had scarcely ever allowed myself\nto hope before.'	2.841269227923819
"Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to\nElizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of\nit;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any\nsatisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante."	2.84158020668959
"If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been,  said\nElizabeth,  and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall\nexactly know what Mr Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has\nnot sixpence of his own."	2.8415898182858124
'When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;\nbut every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.'	2.841874713088681
"She saw instantly that her\ncousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility\nwas just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate\nto hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family."	2.8419885002062144
'Mr Hurst and her\nsister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and\nwere evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.'	2.842077179626667
'--She could have added,  A young man too, like  you , whose very\ncountenance may vouch for your being amiable --but she contented\nherself with  And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from\nchildhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest\nmanner!'	2.8423302588674777
'And I do not think it of light importance\nthat he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every\nbody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.'	2.8427203044654688
'But it is,  returned she;  for Mr Long has just been here, and she\ntold me all about it.'	2.8429714751057023
'She was less handsome than her brother, but there\nwas sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\nunassuming and gentle.'	2.8435870867909783
'Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mr Bennet would have been\nvery miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was\nnot alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her\nrestoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.'	2.8438375155255664
'Lydia--the\nhumiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up\nevery private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,\nElizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of\nseveral minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the\nvoice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke\ncompassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,  I am afraid you have been\nlong desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my\nstay, but real, though unavailing, concern.'	2.844029553400618
'The\nhappiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never\nfelt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as\nwarmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.'	2.8443880855946078
'But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\naccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry\nelsewhere?'	2.8444465510715675
"Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,\n     that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on  your \n     side."	2.8446046951916877
'Louisa and I were agreeing that we\nshould not have known her again.'	2.8450133067760666
'I do think Mr Long is as good\na creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,\nand not at all handsome:'	2.8452043199259784
'Mr Bennet\nwas restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June\nKitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without\ntears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by\nthe following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to\nmention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious\narrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in\nMeryton.'	2.845625310815792
'Jane,  cried Elizabeth,  was there a servant belonging to it, who\ndid not know the whole story before the end of the day?'	2.845859879481141
'The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing\ncivilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a\ncompliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than\ngratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before\nher mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage\nwas exceedingly agreeable to  her .'	2.8460227606820236
"But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good\nof every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of\nthe bad--belongs to you alone."	2.8461023170008093
"Mr Darcy often acknowledged himself to\nbe under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance,\nand when immediately before my father's death, Mr Darcy gave him a\nvoluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to\nbe as much a debt of gratitude to  him , as of affection to myself."	2.84660216611881
'At last she recollected that\nshe had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with\ngreat perseverance.'	2.8466555076590536
'It was more\nthan civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such\nattention.'	2.846858835147131
'CHAPTER XX.\n\n\nMr Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\nsuccessful love; for Mr Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule\nto watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the\ndoor and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she\nentered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in\nwarm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.'	2.847061425890177
'Well,  cried her mother,  it is all very right; who should do it but\nher own uncle?'	2.8474560093122903
'She had known, it seems,\nof their being in love with each other, many weeks.'	2.8484440452817745
'and Mr\nForster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow\none of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!'	2.8487765714677105
'Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get\nthe better of himself.'	2.8488916104212287
'Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr and Mr Gardiner did, a question\nwhich she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.'	2.849407074609401
'I will not tell you what it is.'	2.8494881820708695
'It must be something particular, to take him there at this\ntime of year.'	2.8497806230275344
'No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to\nrain; and then you must stay all night.'	2.8500112699884985
'I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,  said Lady\nCatherine;  and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,\nif she does not practise a great deal.'	2.8502415059406885
"They were then,\nwith no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance,\ntaken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he\nwelcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble\nabode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment."	2.8503654970824304
'Two of her\ngirls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing\nin it.'	2.8504702324963103
'One cannot wonder that so\nvery fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour,\nshould think highly of himself.'	2.850509917363202
'That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was\nanother very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to\nhave as little trouble in the business as possible.'	2.8505565847423457
"Mr and Mr Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,\nby the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but\nsatisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the\ncause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on\nthe postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had\nnever been a favourite with them, Mr and Mr Gardiner could not but be\ndeeply affected."	2.85163756490248
'CHAPTER XV.\n\n\nOn Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr Collins met for breakfast a few\nminutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of\npaying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.'	2.851852156075761
'Reflection must be\nreserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it\nas the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk,\nin which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant\nrecollections.'	2.852471914296619
'Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.'	2.8526203549871454
"I am far from attributing any part of Mr Bingley's conduct to design, \nsaid Elizabeth;  but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others\nunhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery."	2.853081668571056
'Mr Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred\nthousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,\nbut did not live to do it.--Mr Bingley intended it likewise, and\nsometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a\ngood house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those\nwho best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\nremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to\npurchase.'	2.8534739884249354
'How soon any other wishes\nintroduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an\nhour after I had seen you.'	2.853475398070165
"Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's\nconsideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it\nover as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried\nto conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided\nbetween distress and diversion."	2.8536910751089772
'I cannot but wonder,\n     however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at\n     all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.'	2.8537368173351942
'I cannot pretend to be sorry,  said Wickham, after a short\ninterruption,  that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond\ntheir deserts; but with  him  I believe it does not often happen.'	2.854001703313213
'CHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nMr Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,\ninstead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for\nthe better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived\nhim.'	2.8540313332419767
'As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back\nto look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was\nconjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself\nsuddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.'	2.854284903809761
'CHAPTER XV.\n\n\nThe discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw\nElizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many\nhours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.'	2.8549503427244893
"Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no\nworse, she had need to be thankful."	2.85501214664658
'Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,  said Elizabeth,\ncoolly,  will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report\nis in existence.'	2.856044171146766
'But how came you to tell us that he was so\ndisagreeable?'	2.8561020928644627
'There was a\nsomething in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive\nand anxious attention, while she added,\n\n When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that\neither his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from\nknowing him better, his disposition was better understood.'	2.856286255971053
'It had better have happened to  you , Lizzy; you\nwould have laughed yourself out of it sooner.'	2.856760373508567
'Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;\nand Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever\ndared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.'	2.857588887381455
'Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;\nand Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather  knew  that she was happy,\nthan  felt  herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,\nthere were other evils before her.'	2.8585565219478126
'I shall not go away, till you have given me the\nassurance I require.'	2.8587930067296528
'Her character\nwill be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt\nthat ever made herself and her family ridiculous.'	2.8594962954677507
'But\nLizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.'	2.8595062278433714
"She was at least free from the offence of Mr Darcy's farther notice;\nthough often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\ndisengaged, he never came near enough to speak."	2.8596741868908984
'On entering the drawing-room she found the whole\nparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting\nthem to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the\nexcuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay\nbelow with a book.'	2.859973281911963
'As\nfor Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth\nwith a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at\ntable,\n\n This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.'	2.8600381563902233
'But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that\ncheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,\nproceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly\ndisposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded.'	2.8602566224545254
"You will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your\nfamily, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your\ndaughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr Bennet the\ncompliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf."	2.86027207221847
'The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters\nand of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss\nDarcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for\nthe strength of his attachment.'	2.8604745033203827
'Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as\nabsolutely settled.'	2.860491864670177
'Had they fixed on any other man\nit would have been nothing; but  his  perfect indifference, and  your \npointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!'	2.860712412568799
'He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter,\nwhich she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure,  I\nhave been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.'	2.8612778641097814
'Elizabeth could never\naddress her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,\nand, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the\nsake of what had been, rather than what was.'	2.8621960204379078
'Lydia\ntalked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the\nfish she had won, and Mr Collins, in describing the civility of Mr and\nMr Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses\nat whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing\nthat he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage\nbefore the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.'	2.862329563865934
'The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she\nwould, and the argument ended only with the visit.'	2.8623460630158264
'As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they\nshould ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had\nmarked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a\nretrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of\ncontradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those\nfeelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would\nformerly have rejoiced in its termination.'	2.86245013202255
'The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will\nprove what she felt.'	2.8624933545359106
'It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with\nease, cannot write ill.'	2.862501719726397
"My father was not\n     only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always\n     engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the\n     church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it."	2.862512021091898
'At length however Mr Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who\nhad been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no\nlikelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.'	2.8626867454672547
'his\njudgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as\nto leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than\nlovely and amiable.'	2.86276543447116
'In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\nnothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter\nwas unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she\nagain began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and\ncommanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.'	2.8630525603874926
'Indeed I had.'	2.863333173161242
'It drew from her,\nhowever, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually\ndone before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in\nthe country at present.'	2.863337372835474
'The certainty of\nmeeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that\nmight not unreasonably have alarmed her.'	2.864073596218615
'Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of\nthe very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made\nhim happy if they had.'	2.864752921555413
'It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that\nElizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly\nexpressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied,  Say\nnothing of that.'	2.8648508139199436
'It is unlucky,  said she, after a short pause,  that you should not be\nable to see your friends before they leave the country.'	2.865011206468063
'And yet, upon my honour, I\nbelieved what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this\nmoment.'	2.8651158097199714
"The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,\nand all the articles of plate which Mr Collins had promised; and, as he\nhad likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by\nher ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish\nnothing greater.--He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted\nalacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir\nWilliam, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law\nsaid, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear."	2.8657590633816743
'This fine account of him,  whispered her aunt, as they walked,  is not\nquite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.'	2.865971301856206
'Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as\nElizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,\ncame up with him, and eagerly cried out,\n\n Oh, Papa, what news?'	2.8660598706341487
"Many circumstances might make it\n     more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to\n     pursue their first plan; and even if  he  could form such a design\n     against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely,\n     can I suppose her so lost to every thing?--Impossible."	2.8669186410042684
'It ought to be good,  he replied,  it has been the work of many\ngenerations.'	2.86698333952119
"Mr Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his\nfather's life time."	2.8670542764598457
'Who would\nhave thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de\nBourgh in this assembly!--I am most thankful that the discovery is made\nin time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,\nand trust he will excuse my not having done it before.'	2.8671272366409775
'In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of\nthe carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,\n\n I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.'	2.8673871087252722
'Two\ninferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that\nElizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that\nshe herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two\npoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.'	2.867587071521902
'I have been a disappointed man, and\nmy spirits will not bear solitude.'	2.8678007484790116
'Mr Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his\nreception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his\nfirst introduction.'	2.867883964170533
'Mr Collins!'	2.867976463437366
'Heaven forbid!-- That  would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To\nfind a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--Do not wish me\nsuch an evil.'	2.8682957915533063
"When the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies\nall rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when\nall her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her\nmother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated\nwith the rest of the party."	2.868530220339233
'Certainly,  replied Elizabeth-- there are such people, but I hope I am\nnot one of  them .'	2.8687240765827347
'Perhaps,  said Darcy,  I should have judged better, had I sought an\nintroduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers.'	2.86905998594361
'It would look odd to be\nentirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of\n some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the\ntrouble of saying as little as possible.'	2.8692822730567116
'She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of\nbringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away\nwithout enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than\nthe mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.'	2.870023665276809
'The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have\nanswered her hopes; but, alas!'	2.8702846821497694
'She got up, and ran out of the room;\nand returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to\nthe dining-parlour.'	2.8705762651732534
'My dear Jane!'	2.8707222133116614
'The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change\nwas visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or\nthe anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given\nsomething more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of Kitty.'	2.870775588173229
'It was first broken by Mr Annesley, a\ngenteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind\nof discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the\nothers; and between her and Mr Gardiner, with occasional help from\nElizabeth, the conversation was carried on.'	2.871214556018963
"The very first\nsentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for\nthe winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had\ntime to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left\nthe country."	2.871277929656172
'I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.'	2.8716705208650124
'After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two\ngentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the\nbrink of the river for the better inspection of some curious\nwater-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.'	2.872080739937482
'It cannot be for  me , it cannot be for  my  sake\nthat his manners are thus softened.'	2.8734245364605795
'Mr Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some\nrefreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,\ndeclined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,\n\n Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness\non one side of your lawn.'	2.8734281334485083
"She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a\nsolidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no\nmeans so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and\nimprove himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very\nagreeable companion."	2.873679863722172
"Your conduct would be quite as\ndependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were\nmounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay\ntill next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not\ngo--and, at another word, might stay a month."	2.874118214350515
'But in spite of all this\n     fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that\n     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit\n     for  another interest  in the affair.'	2.8741577064733175
'From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and\nwere indebted to Mr Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went\nalong, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,\nwhich he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened\nalmost every day.'	2.8741644886136726
'Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt\nthat there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such\na quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece.'	2.874523094394548
'You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy\nwere sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr Darcy.'	2.8746812444115566
'After sitting\nfor a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,\n\n I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.'	2.874780547329836
'Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\naffectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive\nfrom me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of\nyour regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.'	2.874780671956183
"For God's sake, say no more of\nhis partners."	2.875219512464769
'To know\nthat her daughter would be married was enough.'	2.875364548024614
"She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with\nanxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to\nher eldest sister,  Ah!"	2.876337919497733
'Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all\nlikely to make her more elegant.'	2.87634330330888
"And is\n such  a girl to be my nephew's sister?"	2.8765108491820817
'This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in\nsummer; the windows are full west.'	2.8765108577145777
'Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know.'	2.876533940288176
'About a year ago, she was taken from\n     school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last\n     summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate;\n     and thither also went Mr Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there\n     proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mr\n     Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by\n     her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,\n     whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his\n     kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe\n     herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.'	2.8766257582323402
'Howsoever that may be, you\n     are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined\n     by Mr Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter,\n     to whom I have related the affair.'	2.8766742283046636
'She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it\nwas rather too early to begin.'	2.8770138714964353
'That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\nresentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her\nmarriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe\npossible.'	2.8770286676604795
'Tell him what a dreadful state I am in,--that I am frightened\nout of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me,\nsuch spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at\nheart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.'	2.8772952063575263
'If I were as rich as Mr Darcy,  cried a young Lucas who came with his\nsisters,  I should not care how proud I was.'	2.877548629267613
'Mr Collins,  said she,  speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her\ndaughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,\nI suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his\npatroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.'	2.8775852009935043
'I am sorry to hear  that ; but why did not you tell me so before?'	2.8776971787625527
'A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without\nscolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William\nor Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she\ncould at all forgive their daughter.'	2.8780268692840427
'This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I\nflatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.'	2.8782820450663373
'That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,  cried her\nbrother-- because he does  not  write with ease.'	2.87881915629237
"While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different\ndoors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much\nobjected to be kept waiting for her dinner.--Such formidable accounts of\nher Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,\nwho had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her\nintroduction at Rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had\ndone to his presentation at St. James's."	2.878955786998122
'Mr Darcy is not to be laughed at!'	2.879172314259162
'They have both,  said she,  been deceived, I dare say, in some way or\nother, of which we can form no idea.'	2.879312216041895
'Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners\nwere always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been\nexactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he\nclaimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.'	2.879735830012191
'His behaviour to us has,\n     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.'	2.8797559471577503
'The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\nentrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the\nfinest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a\nsignificant look and smile from Mr Annesley to Miss Darcy had been\ngiven, to remind her of her post.'	2.879868436141817
"From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's\nsociety she was of course carefully kept, and though Mr Wickham\nfrequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of\nballs and young men, her father would never consent to her going."	2.8801064921595887
'If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often\nseemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might\nsettle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity\nunblemished could make him.'	2.8801676602364807
"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr Bingley,  said her mother,\n I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on Mr\nBennet's manor."	2.880546703349112
"Lydia does not leave me because she is married;\nbut only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off."	2.8808849739457627
'Mr Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was\nrather offended; and therefore checked her laugh.'	2.881079634787078
'That he is\nas false and deceitful, as he is insinuating.'	2.8812468861335097
'I had not thought Mr Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\nhim, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be\ndespising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\ndescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as\nthis!'	2.881725236677395
"I want to know,  said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\nsister's,  what you have learnt about Mr Wickham."	2.8819246764850135
'I have no right to give  my  opinion,  said Wickham,  as to his being\nagreeable or otherwise.'	2.882066057443613
'I would go and see her, if I could have the\ncarriage.'	2.8820891334058265
'If your abhorrence of\n      me  should make  my  assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented\n     by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may\n     be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find\n     some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course\n     of the morning.'	2.8820986590747815
'Mr Collins no sooner saw the two\ngirls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which\nCharlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked\nto dine at Rosings the next day.'	2.882368506523944
'It was consoling, that he should know she had\nsome relations for whom there was no need to blush.'	2.8830257100032384
'She had not at first thought very seriously of\ngoing thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan,\nand she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure\nas well as greater certainty.'	2.8832925621135157
'The\nwish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his\nfeeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a\nblow as this.'	2.883337994324056
'The farewell between herself and Mr Wickham was perfectly friendly; on\nhis side even more.'	2.8834693271281076
'To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of\nconversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the\nhappiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm\nhouse.'	2.8838349484595027
'They were in fact very fine ladies; not\ndeficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of\nbeing agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.'	2.8847628236504907
"The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous\nconviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;\nand she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained\nhimself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to\nherself; when her father continued,\n\n You look conscious."	2.884829250506973
'Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only  child )\nI was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father\nparticularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,\nalmost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond\nmy own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to\n wish  at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with\nmy own.'	2.8854371730048523
'Mr Bennet was not in the\nhabit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five\nset off together.'	2.885673891000753
'You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you\nare warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking\nopenly.'	2.8860536025921295
'Indeed, Mr Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention\nall that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me\nleave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,\nand such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear.'	2.8863126031320543
"He was resolutely silent however; and, from a\ndetermination of making him speak, she continued,\n\n I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all\nwere to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect\nyour saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, ' She \na beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she\nseemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at\none time."	2.886741757664288
"He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading\nMr Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her\nat last to go--saying, as she quitted the room,  If any young men come\nfor Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure."	2.886898633295425
'I am not to be intimidated into\nanything so wholly unreasonable.'	2.8871689670632406
'But the wife of Mr\nDarcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily\nattached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause\nto repine.'	2.8880362465252043
'But\nI have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.'	2.888149429085358
'CHAPTER X.\n\n\nMore than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly\nmeet Mr Darcy.--She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that\nshould bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever\nhappening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a\nfavourite haunt of hers.--How it could occur a second time therefore was\nvery odd!--Yet it did, and even a third.'	2.8884225787742133
'We are not on friendly terms,\nand it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\navoiding  him  but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of\nvery great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.'	2.888623343614311
"How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from\none's own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr\nCollins too!--Why should  he  have it more than anybody else?"	2.888676548362117
'His cousin was as absurd\nas he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,\nmaintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,\nand except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in\nhis pleasure.'	2.8888507746987577
'I am not so\n     selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.'	2.8888918062171474
"Were it for nothing but his love of you, I\nmust always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your\nhusband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me."	2.8891533053856815
'But he is a\nliberal master, I suppose, and  that  in the eye of a servant\ncomprehends every virtue.'	2.8896435309635735
'I have found out,  said he,  by a singular accident, that there is now\nin the room a near relation of my patroness.'	2.889707801286443
'While the contents of the first\nletter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that\nWickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for\nmoney; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared\nincomprehensible.'	2.8901358799695585
"My dear Friend,\n\n      If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and\n     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our\n     lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never\n     end without a quarrel."	2.890226732521301
'With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr Wickham and the\nofficers, Mr Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the\nyoung ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a\nkind listener in Mr Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most\nabundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.'	2.890267953609575
"Mr Darcy had been at her\nsister's wedding."	2.890714536302617
"In a few days Mr Bingley returned Mr Bennet's visit, and sat about ten\nminutes with him in his library."	2.8907635832647465
'They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to\nimagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at\nfirst was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would\nbe the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made\nsome slight observation on the dance.'	2.890948713862201
"I believe him to be Lady Catherine's  nephew ."	2.8909616389242485
'But if  we  do not venture, somebody else will; and after\nall, Mr Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as\nshe will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will\ntake it on myself.'	2.8911846727318418
'I knew,  said he,  that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was\nnecessary.'	2.8912612278285286
'You  are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,  said Mr\nDarcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.'	2.8915990955535236
'Another time, Lizzy,  said her mother,  I would not dance with  him ,\nif I were you.'	2.892474068968264
'He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in\nthe world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.'	2.8932129889816403
'To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\nshall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\naware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\nin the 4 per cents.'	2.8934482123945076
'Mr Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great\npoliteness by the whole family.'	2.893582495425645
'A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de\nBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he\nfelt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,\nmingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a\nclergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of\npride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.'	2.893584488759422
"As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was\nordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their\nboxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and\nLydia's purchases, were seated in it."	2.8938501781929538
'Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for\nthe kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice\nbeing given on such a point, without being resented.'	2.893968193383476
'But she would not be secure.'	2.8945144485369165
"Every thing being settled between  them , Mr Darcy's next step was\n     to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in\n     Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home."	2.8952731231767177
"Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more\ninterest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer\nMr Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided\nopinion, that whenever Mr Collins should be in possession of the\nLongbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife\nshould make their appearance at St. James's."	2.8956256466193118
'I know very well, madam,  said he,  that when persons sit down to a\ncard table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I\nam not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.'	2.8957758094165307
'If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill\nfrom the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and\nit will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the\ndark.'	2.8957894462897067
'Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not\nwait on him.'	2.8963935121623385
'Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;\nand as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in\nher reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him\nlanguage so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time\nall intercourse was at an end.'	2.8966545556269954
"Rendered\nspiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to\nhis brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and\nleave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable\nfor continuing their pursuit."	2.896843777182129
"Mr Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his\nforbearance; and though Mr Philips, as well as her sister, stood in\ntoo much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good\nhumour encouraged, yet, whenever she  did  speak, she must be vulgar."	2.896940002497683
"My dear sir,  replied Mr Collins,  I am particularly obliged to you\nfor this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so\nmaterial a step without her ladyship's concurrence."	2.896977351200552
'Jane was not deceived, but she was\naffected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing\nher a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.'	2.8970344730333237
"It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's\ninterested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those\nwishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man\nso totally independent of every one."	2.8973270529165602
'Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of\nher stay, as they had been at first.'	2.8973682783965624
'Four nieces\nof Mr Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and\nit was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who\nwas merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite\ndelighted with her.'	2.897389040791907
"My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light\nit places Mr Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a\nmanner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for.--It is\nimpossible."	2.8974284672751605
'I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,  said he, as soon\nas she allowed him to speak.'	2.8974495178981416
'At\nthat moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\nthrough the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr\nDarcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his\ndancing and his partner.'	2.899227562127059
"The promised\nletter of thanks from Mr Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their\nfather, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a\ntwelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted."	2.899263927538719
'I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\nno want of subject.--We may compare our different opinions.'	2.89929124916166
'Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!'	2.8993746464698464
'Lizzy,  cried her mother,  remember where you are, and do not run on in\nthe wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.'	2.899487224481893
'I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment\nof her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children,\nproduced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,\nwell-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was\nlucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in\nso unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and\ninvariably silly.'	2.8995458475873916
'It had given him a\ndisgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and\nquitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a\nmile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he\ncould think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by\nbusiness, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.'	2.899568548796241
'But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr Bingley when he comes into\nthe neighbourhood.'	2.8996967019619
'As it was certain, however, that\nsomebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid\nthe confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the\nshrubbery.'	2.899696923024991
'Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.'	2.900324848623855
'An express came at twelve last night, just as we were\n     all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was\n     gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,\n     with Wickham!--Imagine our surprise.'	2.9008769049376006
'They insist also on\n     my seeing Mr Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear\n     of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache\n     there is not much the matter with me.'	2.900996004378527
'However, I did not hear above one word in ten,\nfor I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham.'	2.901078869697585
'She wanted to hear of him, when there\nseemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.'	2.9014708184540807
'But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object.'	2.9019277340794933
'Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not\nbeen the case.'	2.901980549582962
'I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider\nyour situation with much compassion.'	2.9027911737358383
'Her\ndisappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her\nsister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could\nnever be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as\nBingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.'	2.902922069874024
'Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my\nlife, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see\nuncommonly pretty.'	2.903818055634159
'You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr Collins, for she vows she will\nnot have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and\nnot have  her .'	2.9038549872269956
'I am particularly unlucky\nin meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a\npart of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree\nof credit.'	2.904081677963929
'Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were\nthe other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact\nnothing to do elsewhere.'	2.9044527455019185
'Lizzy, to\nknow that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear\nfamily!'	2.904467545408546
'But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom\nthey had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking\nwith an officer on the other side of the way.'	2.9044911750159557
'It\nwas not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.'	2.9051525711961808
'But before they heard again from Mr Gardiner, a letter arrived for\ntheir father, from a different quarter, from Mr Collins; which, as Jane\nhad received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,\nshe accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his\nletters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.'	2.905450741190559
'This\nhowever was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time\ncomfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with\nCharlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she\nhad often great enjoyment out of doors.'	2.9054871628733925
'He had not been long seated\nbefore he complimented Mr Bennet on having so fine a family of\ndaughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this\ninstance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did\nnot doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.'	2.905620573727228
"And\ngathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth\ncalled out,\n\n Dear Ma'am, do not go.--I beg you will not go.--Mr Collins must excuse\nme.--He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear."	2.906956313527213
'The general prejudice against Mr Darcy is so violent,\nthat it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to\nattempt to place him in an amiable light.'	2.907380806715829
"Yes, Ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just\nas affable to the poor."	2.9075337426732863
'You do not look\nwell.'	2.9076794294692654
'And even when it\nwas settled that Lydia should go with Mr Forster, the necessity of\nopening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.'	2.907936009164901
'Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke\nten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at\none time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most\nconscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.'	2.908252119949089
'But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any\nconsideration in the world,  replied Darcy.'	2.908472666673228
"CHAPTER VII.\n\n\nSir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough\nto convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of\nher possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met\nwith."	2.9086426639677527
'Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,  said Mr Collins\nvery gravely-- but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all\ndisapprove of you.'	2.9090284576244922
'She\ncould not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,\nwrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\nLydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been\nintended.'	2.909075237090362
"which will not be yours till after your mother's\ndecease, is all that you may ever be entitled to."	2.909927596075445
'One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two\nelder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,\n\n Lizzy, I never gave  you  an account of my wedding, I believe.'	2.9099494498427383
'Next time you call,  said she,  I hope we shall be more lucky.'	2.9108071713618897
"From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr Darcy\nhad been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mr Gardiner's\nlong letter, but now, having  that  to communicate which she knew would\nbe most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt\nhad already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as\nfollows:"	2.9109485606358594
'The feelings\nof the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so\nwidely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant\ncircumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten.'	2.9114107468785164
'She had been watching him the last hour,\nshe said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr Wickham\nappeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation,\nbut unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the\nofficers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become  stupid,\ndisagreeable fellows.'	2.911500952526828
'She turned from sister to sister, demanding their\ncongratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly\nround the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and\nobserved, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been\nthere.'	2.911724893766612
'With a glance she saw,\nthat he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his\npoliteness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;\nbut she had not got beyond the words  delightful,  and  charming,  when\nsome unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of\nPemberley from her, might be mischievously construed.'	2.912001989272493
'My \nfather began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr Philips,\nappears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use\nto the late Mr Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the\nPemberley property.'	2.912026818538492
'My friend has an excellent understanding--though\nI am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr Collins as the wisest\nthing she ever did.'	2.9123442093386043
'Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he\nspoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his\nenquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay\nin Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the\ndistraction of his thoughts.'	2.9125027766448546
'for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great\nbooks, and make extracts.'	2.9126955607292913
"Five daughters\nsuccessively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mr\nBennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he\nwould."	2.9129522060089323
'Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been\nsometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward\nwith impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the\nsatisfaction she had promised herself.'	2.9130051332698708
'This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree.'	2.9140055747703855
'Instead of\nviewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and\nwelcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--But no, --recollecting\nherself,-- that could never be:'	2.914073749574063
'Mary,  said she,  I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!'	2.914171600887965
'She had always seen it with pain; but\nrespecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of\nherself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to\nbanish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation\nand decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own\nchildren, was so highly reprehensible.'	2.914632832931747
'Miss Bingley sees that her brother is\nin love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.'	2.9150640750060894
'In\ntruth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble\nparsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it an object of\ncompassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.'	2.9152359202792795
'Had they been\nonly ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his\ndiscrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that\nmoment alighted from his horse or his carriage.'	2.9159091689405527
'In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there\nwith Mr Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in\nLondon.'	2.9162731725257203
'As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following\nmanner:--\n\n You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my\njourney hither.'	2.916535654491683
"But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity\n     of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given\n     the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her\n     temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--That I was\n     desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will\n     venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually\n     influenced by my hopes or fears.--I did not believe her to be\n     indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial\n     conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.--My objections to\n     the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged\n     to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my\n     own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to\n     my friend as to me.--But there were other causes of\n     repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to\n     an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to\n     forget, because they were not immediately before me.--These causes\n     must be stated, though briefly.--The situation of your mother's\n     family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that\n     total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed\n     by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by\n     your father.--Pardon me.--It pains me to offend you."	2.9170443343200825
'I assure you, Madam,  he replied,  that she does not need such advice.'	2.917175345610749
'CHAPTER XV.\n\n\nMr Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had\nbeen but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of\nhis life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and\nmiserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he\nhad merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful\nacquaintance.'	2.917339191839765
'He had not\na temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of\npreference which was often given me.'	2.9175441592948914
'My real purpose was to see  you , and to judge, if I could, whether I\nmight ever hope to make you love me.'	2.918533290804984
'Her air\nwas not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to\nmake her visitors forget their inferior rank.'	2.9190421118735492
'However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his\nfirst entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds\nof the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful\nproperty of some one or other of their daughters.'	2.919076841767738
'The\ntown where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where\nthey were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of\nher curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,\nDovedale, or the Peak.'	2.9197962111692712
'In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,\nwith occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the\nimprovements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the\ngentlemen joined them; and he found in Mr Philips a very attentive\nlistener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she\nheard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as\nsoon as she could.'	2.9200561101032125
'To be\nsure that  did  seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he\n did --I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something\nabout Mr Robinson.'	2.9203835802328055
'I do not believe a word of it, my dear.'	2.920564122307188
'Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only\nwanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern\nin parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer\nof the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the\npresent.'	2.9206970457152543
'In a few days more, we\nmay gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married,\nand have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as\nlost.'	2.9212336301026482
'But, perhaps his sister does as well\nfor the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he\nlikes with her.'	2.9219208490308146
'But whether she\nwere violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it\nwas certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to\nher sense; and she could no more bear that Mr Darcy should hear the\nfirst raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her\ndisapprobation.'	2.9234721124797605
'But,\nmy dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley\ntells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\ndegree less sensible of  your  merit than when he took leave of you on\nTuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of\nbeing in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.'	2.923524431130117
"Mr\nBennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's\ninterruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would\nresume his book; but Mr Collins, after assuring them that he bore his\nyoung cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any\naffront, seated himself at another table with Mr Bennet, and prepared\nfor backgammon."	2.9238195407026715
"it must be my uncle's doings!"	2.923848521161052
'This Mr\n     Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he\n     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town.'	2.9245067638509417
'Her mother\nimpatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady\nCatherine would not come in again and rest herself.'	2.9247732809275107
'Miss Darcy looked as if she\nwished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\nshort sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.'	2.9250882210568694
"The motive professed, was his conviction of its being\n     owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well\n     known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,\n     to love or confide in him."	2.9256695735845772
'How abominable!--I wonder that the very\npride of this Mr Darcy has not made him just to you!--If from no better\nmotive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for\ndishonesty I must call it.'	2.926017778342763
'But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him,\nas to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?'	2.9263609120105802
'He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my\nacquaintance, but that is all.'	2.926371748434696
'I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I\nmay perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion  of  him, and  to  him, too\nfreely.'	2.9265154721657582
'He\n was  coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had\nany idea of their not being gone to Scotland:'	2.9265338285502933
'Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in\n     London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they\n     would have taken up their abode with her.'	2.9270417030279026
'Ignorant as you previously were of every thing\n     concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and\n     suspicion certainly not in your inclination.'	2.927433805692009
'You are very cruel,  said her sister,  you will not let me smile, and\nare provoking me to it every moment.'	2.928175486718931
"Thursday was to be the wedding day,\nand on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose\nto take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and\nreluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her\nout of the room."	2.92820363109179
'But though\nevery thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him\nby any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend\nthat she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion.'	2.9284762440947993
'Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many\npeople he knew, but  he  had never seen any thing but affability in her.'	2.928773503590427
'CHAPTER XXII.\n\n\nThe Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the\nchief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr Collins.'	2.9292255197450072
'Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of\nthe moment, been led to make Mr Darcy acquainted with their fears for\nher sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper\ntermination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its\nunfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the\nspot.'	2.929402928793269
'Something he supposed might be attributed\nto his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much\nattention in the whole course of his life.'	2.9308798756385315
'With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held\nthere in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the\nson of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known\nfact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind\nhim, which Mr Darcy afterwards discharged.'	2.930950780663441
'The more I see\nof the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms\nmy belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the\nlittle dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit\nor sense.'	2.9310236711063458
'It was some consolation to\nthink that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,\nand a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be\nwith Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her\nspirits, by all that affection could do.'	2.9310609839867316
'Your plan is a good one,  replied Elizabeth,  where nothing is in\nquestion but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined\nto get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.'	2.931104196005702
'The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a\nsecret.'	2.9313244975524664
'but from what the report of\ntheir engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;\ntill she recollected that  his  being the intimate friend of Bingley,\nand  her  being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the\nexpectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply\nthe idea.'	2.9319563779939304
'Mr Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted\nby the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,\nhis arrival was no great inconvenience to Mr Bennet.'	2.932084569902746
'I will read it to you--\n\n When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which\ntook him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we\nare certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when\nCharles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have\ndetermined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend\nhis vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.'	2.9322599194525947
'This he considered sufficient encouragement,\nand the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her,\nimmediately followed.'	2.9324555865938904
'I now give it to  you , if you are resolved on\nhaving him.'	2.93263513428569
'He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by\nbeing impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.'	2.9328931593459346
'No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she\nhad almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,\nthat could be so called.'	2.932951534654242
"If I have wounded your sister's\n     feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which\n     governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have\n     not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more\n     weighty accusation, of having injured Mr Wickham, I can only\n     refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my\n     family."	2.932977157789916
'Her teeth are\ntolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which\nhave sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing\nextraordinary in them.'	2.9331998847714895
'As I did the other day,  said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile;  very\ntrue, it will be wise in me to refrain from  that .'	2.9333774603739
'The very last evening was spent\nthere; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of\ntheir journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,\nand was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right\nway, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the\nwork of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.'	2.9336934148941785
'You need not send them word at\n     Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the\n     surprise the greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia\n     Wickham.'	2.9343639569861004
'He has made me so happy,  said she, one evening,  by telling me, that\nhe was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!'	2.9348449800429046
'--It vexed her to see him\nexpose himself to such a man.'	2.9353362785891672
'It must be his own doing.--He is his own master.'	2.9355201368157693
'Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;\nand she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,\n I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him\never since he was four years old.'	2.9356995680283418
'He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\nfrom a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to\nconjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known\ntill its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost\nsecure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,\nhe was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.'	2.9358284339542253
"She\nsoon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding\nto the efforts of his aunt, who  did  call on him in her return through\nLondon, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the\nsubstance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on\nevery expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension,\npeculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that\nsuch a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from\nher nephew, which  she  had refused to give."	2.9360714016986766
'She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in\ndisposition and talents, would most suit her.'	2.9363618169239425
'But you  will  know it, when I have told you what happened the very\nnext day.'	2.9367559329227046
'Mr Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to\nsupper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the\nothers, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.'	2.9371027618601007
'Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.'	2.9374801304064935
"said Lydia stoutly,  I am not afraid; for though I  am  the\nyoungest, I'm the tallest."	2.9392202881469967
'Mr Bennet indeed said little; but the\nladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr Collins seemed neither in need\nof encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.'	2.939520297509441
"Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated\nlook; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his\nembarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of\naccents,\n\n You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr Darcy, will readily\ncomprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume\neven the  appearance  of what is right."	2.9398592107418513
'It is\nnot likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it\nmight strike them that they could be more economically, though less\nexpeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.'	2.940485754442738
'Mr Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was\nturned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated\nhimself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into\nconversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the\nprobability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,\ndullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the\nskill of the speaker.'	2.9405481376994476
'Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little\nattention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near\nthe card-table, and stationed herself between Mr Bingley and his eldest\nsister, to observe the game.'	2.940798655411655
'Any place would do, of about three or four\n     hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr Darcy about it,\n     if you had rather not.'	2.94084928322162
'He\ncertainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that\nlook was disputable.'	2.941082171502562
'It was\nnecessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on\nsuch occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mr\nBennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.'	2.9411060843122665
'Of\nthis she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made\nhimself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough\nto dance with.'	2.9413291105309614
'I do not remember her name among the ladies at\ncourt.'	2.942427339733144
"In as short a time as Mr Collins's long speeches would allow, every\nthing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they\nentered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was\nto make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be\nwaved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his\nhappiness."	2.9426057293526804
"Lydia has no\nbrothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's\nbehaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever\nseemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that  he  would\ndo as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in\nsuch a matter."	2.9435177988662704
'He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London.'	2.9438288096502103
'Well, my comfort is, I am sure\nJane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he\nhas done.'	2.9441354670808595
'Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never\nsaw any thing of it.'	2.944231277140662
'Yes, there was something in  that ; I told you so from the\nfirst, you may remember.'	2.9444020191313887
'They will then join his regiment,\n     unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from\n     Mr Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all,\n     before she leaves the South.'	2.9445299766176083
'He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.'	2.9446422761121904
'People  did  say,\nyou meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope\nit is not true.'	2.9455055038921336
'when I went away, I am sure\nI had no more idea of being married till I came back again!'	2.94600733308588
'By all that I have\never read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human\nnature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us\nwho do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some\nquality or other, real or imaginary.'	2.9463710742377844
'Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?--At\npresent I have not room to do them justice.'	2.9468687862025105
'I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,  replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise\nand emotion,  that you have ever been informed of what may, in a\nmistaken light, have given you uneasiness.'	2.9472533699738057
'Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mr Collins and\n     myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable\n     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest\n     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.'	2.94847071267984
'I wonder when\nyou  would  have spoken, if I had not asked you!'	2.9486289371261494
'She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.'	2.948711132116593
'I have been a\nselfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.'	2.9491891020199317
'I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have\nseen it in the papers.'	2.9494874587383353
'Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them\nmutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no\nreal confidence could ever subsist between them again.'	2.949526469307304
'Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\nall.'	2.9496396436174814
'I should have considered it as part of my duty, and\nthe exertion would soon have been nothing.'	2.9496429088711658
'She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were\nassembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of\nsurprise.--That she should have walked three miles so early in the day,\nin such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mr\nHurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her\nin contempt for it.'	2.9496539462869005
'Surprise was the least\nof her feelings on this developement.'	2.9500513207292247
'It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that\nthey were under obligations to a person who could never receive a\nreturn.'	2.9519407953257453
'I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had.'	2.9520387291103134
'The first wish of my heart,  said she to herself,  is never more to be\nin company with either of them.'	2.9522066849031012
"She remembered also, that till the Netherfield\nfamily had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but\nherself; but that after their removal, it had been every where\ndiscussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr\nDarcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the\nfather, would always prevent his exposing the son."	2.952918747739111
'You\nmust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.'	2.953329218632245
'Anne would have\nbeen a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.'	2.9533684595296372
'As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile\nacross the park.--Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and\nElizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such\nraptures as Mr Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but\nslightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the\nhouse, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally\ncost Sir Lewis De Bourgh.'	2.953382963840876
"Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on\nMr Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she\ncalled at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,\nthough Mr Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been\nenough to drive happiness away."	2.953458914006312
'That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a\nball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly\nbrought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.'	2.9537109083057356
"Her mother's ungraciousness,\nmade the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind;\nand she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell\nhim, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of\nthe family."	2.954062069503951
'Mr Darcy\nis impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth,  we  are\nscarcely less eager to meet her again.'	2.9542037365522846
'Mr Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and\nwas beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they\nwere suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth\nhappening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,\nwas all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.'	2.9545457308322938
'She respected, she\nesteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his\nwelfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to\ndepend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both\nthat she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still\npossessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.'	2.9548079068340862
'Yes,  replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer,  but  that \nwas only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have\nconsidered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.'	2.9549046778156947
'The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mr Bennet had time to\ntell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in\nmomentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed\ntheir all walking out.'	2.9549519678874034
'Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment\nof her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many\nof the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on\nthe business.'	2.955353069432774
'But, my dear Elizabeth,  she added,  what sort of girl is Miss King?'	2.955719568951491
'I am not going to run away, Papa,  said Kitty, fretfully;  if  I \nshould ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.'	2.9558521931271504
'As to what\nrestraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a\ndishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know\nnothing of the effects that such a step might produce.'	2.956411796701396
'Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained\nquietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned\ninto the drawing-room.'	2.956679692555532
'yes--it would be much better to\nwait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter\nwould be at Meryton again.'	2.956794917808801
"But\nher commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means\nsatisfy Mr Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's\npraise into his own hands."	2.9571079127468924
'But she would not\nallow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be\nsaid, for the present.'	2.9574124626056895
"that  abominable Mr Darcy!--My father's opinion of me does\nme the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it."	2.957513416507527
'The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I\nthink it is well expressed.'	2.9575575555181537
'He had before believed her to return his\n     affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--But Bingley has\n     great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment\n     than on his own.--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived\n     himself, was no very difficult point.'	2.9578217506771542
'As that was the\ncase, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it\nnecessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it\napparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the\nneighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown?'	2.9580171348811253
"This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman\nhimself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain\npossession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'\nconsent, there was still something to be wished for."	2.9583290446980124
'But as it is--you\nmust not let your fancy run away with you.'	2.9587700710782374
'At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and\nthe others returned into the house.'	2.960064137742508
'From what we have seen of him,  continued Mr Gardiner,  I really\nshould not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by\nany body, as he has done by poor Wickham.'	2.9606164430504336
'After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr\nBennet coolly observed,\n\n From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two\nof the silliest girls in the country.'	2.9607391702576615
'Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat\nthe matter as you do now.'	2.960996714032725
"E. GARDINER. \n\nMr Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal\nfrom the ----shire, as clearly as Mr Gardiner could do."	2.9610713493863683
'Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,\nand as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,\nwhich Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so\noccupied, she might have forgotten where she was.'	2.961154007326421
'I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with\n     who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the\n     world I love, and he is an angel.'	2.961267706595742
"She asked her at different times, how many sisters\nshe had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of\nthem were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they\nhad been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her\nmother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her\nquestions, but answered them very composedly.--Lady Catherine then\nobserved,\n\n Your father's estate is entailed on Mr Collins, I think."	2.9614323807207743
"In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help\nfeeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting\nin this interference."	2.9618733064259617
"As a brother, a landlord, a master, she\nconsidered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--How\nmuch of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--How much of\ngood or evil must be done by him!"	2.963941377845761
'I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly\ndid.'	2.964228157079337
'In his library he had been\nalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told\nElizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the\nhouse, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,\nwas most prompt in inviting Mr Collins to join his daughters in their\nwalk; and Mr Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker\nthan a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and\ngo.'	2.9642403399442836
"I was not in a humour to\nwait for any opening of your's."	2.965336340131531
'Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would\n     write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.'	2.9653480863074506
'Colonel Fitzwilliam had called\nat the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr Darcy they had\nonly seen at church.'	2.9654305392388913
'and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would\nbe accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of\ninferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to\nthe family!'	2.9654392825090854
'I have just as much\nright to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.'	2.9657755706204876
'And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and\nadmire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.'	2.9660830356086514
'A man of honour could not have doubted the\nintention, but Mr Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\nconditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\nto it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.'	2.966094100252963
"A resemblance in good humour\nand good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of\ntheir  three  months' acquaintance they had been intimate  two ."	2.966222085144207
'She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each\ncalled during her absence; Mr Darcy, only for a few minutes to take\nleave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least\nan hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her\ntill she could be found.--Elizabeth could but just  affect  concern in\nmissing him; she really rejoiced at it.'	2.966710006604956
'You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings\nin this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.'	2.9670474817874317
'She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,\n\n You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way\nthat would have tempted me to accept it.'	2.96709611484499
'I am not now to learn,  replied Mr Collins, with a formal wave of the\nhand,  that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the\nman whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their\nfavour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a\nthird time.'	2.9681696808399316
'We\nshall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some\nballs, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.'	2.9682423581637583
'Impossible, Mr Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him\nmyself; how can you be so teazing?'	2.968440226154465
'Yes, madam,  said Mr Bennet, delighted to speak to a lady Catherine.'	2.9686895926382717
'Your superior knowledge of your sister must make\n     the latter probable.--If it be so, if I have been misled by such\n     error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been\n     unreasonable.'	2.9694994641470918
'He is just what a young man ought to be,  said she,  sensible, good\nhumoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease,\nwith such perfect good breeding!'	2.9698339266288842
"His character sunk on every\nreview of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible\nadvantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr\nDarcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly\nregret what he had thrown away."	2.969902270905622
'I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.'	2.9705241432660547
'My dear Jane, Mr Collins is\na conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well\nas I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries\nhim, cannot have a proper way of thinking.'	2.9708903918936667
'If it was\nnot for the entail I should not mind it.'	2.9709788736775464
'There he had talked to her\nfriends, when he could not to herself.'	2.971897245538484
"As they drove to Mr Gardiner's\ndoor, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when\nthey entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,\nlooking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and\nlovely as ever."	2.972066164980831
'With amazement did\nshe first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;\nand steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to\ngive, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.'	2.972333013291711
'It keeps him in good\nhumour,  said she,  and I am more obliged to you than I can express.'	2.9729964579333763
"CHAPTER IX.\n\n\nTheir sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her\nprobably more than she felt for herself."	2.9731295165700806
'She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse\nwith her, he might have better success.'	2.9731549341347314
'Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do every\nthing in his power to satisfy us on this head.'	2.9735446734471056
'Mr Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while\nSir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings\nfound a rapid vent.'	2.973894720202218
"The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering\nvisitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his\nwife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of\ndoing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady\nCatherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough."	2.9739172998837637
"CHAPTER XIV.\n\n\nOne morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been\nformed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the\ndining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the\nsound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the\nlawn."	2.9739902207753253
'She felt it so; and though, in\nlooking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity,\ncould be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they\nhad feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they\nhad gained.'	2.973991313896468
'The gentlemen\npronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was\nmuch handsomer than Mr Bingley, and he was looked at with great\nadmiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust\nwhich turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be\nproud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his\nlarge estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\nforbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared\nwith his friend.'	2.974022965056486
'He has been so unlucky as to lose  your  friendship,  replied Elizabeth\nwith emphasis,  and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all\nhis life.'	2.9740930323515524
"Mr Wickham's happiness and her own was per force\ndelayed a little longer, and Mr Collins's proposal accepted with as\ngood a grace as she could."	2.9744834879756588
'Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real\noccasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to\noppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her\ntongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it\nbetter that  one  only of the household, and the one whom they could\nmost trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the\nsubject.'	2.9750875079298438
"From the entrance hall, of which Mr Collins pointed out, with a\nrapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed\nthe servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine,\nher daughter, and Mr Jenkinson were sitting.--Her Ladyship, with great\ncondescension, arose to receive them; and as Mr Collins had settled it\nwith her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was\nperformed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks\nwhich he would have thought necessary."	2.976169416955933
'Teaze him--laugh at\nhim.--Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.'	2.976373948057517
"But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon\nyounger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and\namusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to\nmarry early.--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of\nyouth, as the first."	2.976506528277424
'With a\nbook he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\ngood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised\nsuch splendid expectations.'	2.9768000191762445
"Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady\nCatherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a\nmoment's deliberation,\n\n I am not."	2.9774398229390844
'His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;\nand the kind of half-expectation which Mr Gardiner had formed, of\ntheir being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.'	2.9781065132087825
'you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.'	2.9783083028854778
'I know little of the game, at present,  said he,  but I shall be glad\nto improve myself, for in my situation of life----  Mr Philips was\nvery thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.'	2.9783236423319313
'I should never have said Mr Collins\nwas settled  near  her family.'	2.9787998945385876
"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if\npossible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,\nwhether Wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to\nknow in what part of the town he has now concealed himself."	2.979509413053834
"Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's\nway."	2.9795325903522643
'He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could\n     so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed\n     seeing him, till after the departure of the former.'	2.9797722426723268
"Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had\nno sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former\nacquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an\nintercourse renewed after many years discontinuance."	2.9804479120349723
"Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily\ndrawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mr Bennet's being quite\nunable to sit alone."	2.9806171461520212
'She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton\nscheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under\nfrequent discussion between her parents.'	2.9808853274135068
'Elizabeth, construing all\nthis into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on\nthis account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors\nleft them, capable of considering the last half hour with some\nsatisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been\nlittle.'	2.9813795310302194
'She was afraid of talking longer of his\nfriend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the\ntrouble of finding a subject to him.'	2.9814805324390026
'He bore with philosophy the conviction that\nElizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude\nand falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every\nthing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on\nto make his fortune.'	2.982072640147007
"Mr Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in\nthe course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her\nsister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the\nconversation."	2.982270330558996
'If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea\nof there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.'	2.9824433433420867
'Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him\nthat Mr Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as\nan impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it\nwas not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either\nside, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr Darcy, the superior in\nconsequence, to begin the acquaintance.--Mr Collins listened to her\nwith the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she\nceased speaking, replied thus,\n\n My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your\nexcellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your\nunderstanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference\nbetween the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those\nwhich regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider\nthe clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank\nin the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the\nsame time maintained.'	2.9835701052076398
'MY DEAR HARRIET,\n\n      You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help\n     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am\n     missed.'	2.984308758372178
'My good qualities are under your protection, and you are\nto exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me\nto find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may\nbe; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling\nto come to the point at last.'	2.9844755249483335
"If you were aware,  said Elizabeth,  of the very great disadvantage to\nus all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and\nimprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you\nwould judge differently in the affair."	2.9845620280771863
'He had never before supposed\nthat, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be\ndone with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present\narrangement.'	2.984882699770393
"Mr Darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart."	2.9850119384061435
'You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr Bingley,  she added,  for when\nyou went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with\nus, as soon as you returned.'	2.985290484756415
"and various were the subjects\nwhich occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table,\nafter the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mr Bennet was\ndoubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present\nfashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,\nretailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice\nrather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various\npleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her."	2.9858670779679484
'The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are\non their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.'	2.9864715374807904
"They\nran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the\nlibrary;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of\nseeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the\nbutler, who said,\n\n If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the\nlittle copse."	2.9873321832951207
'That among his own connections he was\nesteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a\nbrother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of\nhis sister as to prove him capable of  some  amiable feeling.'	2.9878268734685927
'Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\ncontinue the subject.'	2.988795990544843
'But the fact is, that\nbeing, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\nfather, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy\nmyself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that\nthe loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy\nevent takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be\nfor several years.'	2.9890302126395394
"it is\nall for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to\nhim, except just now and then."	2.989287646325762
'And she was only sixteen last June.'	2.989400973826491
'However, your coming just at this time is the\ngreatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of\nlong sleeves.'	2.9897473733455007
"Mr Collins,\nseeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much\nas possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr Collins\ncould not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather\ndispleased by her staying at home."	2.989837906319426
'A young man, such\nas you describe Mr Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl\nfor a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets\nher, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.'	2.990237552207189
'Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr Bingley had been a most delightful\nfriend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked\nherself.'	2.990367963583789
'In the evening, soon after Mr Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw\nMr Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was\nextreme.'	2.9905393318805746
'At present I will not say more, but perhaps\nwhen we are better acquainted---- \n\nHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each\nother.'	2.991227925955928
'If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the\nneighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we\nmight possibly get a settled family there.'	2.9915540760860124
'But there is one\nof her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I\ndare say, very agreeable.'	2.991697601321713
'Shall we ask him why a man of sense and\neducation, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend\nhimself to strangers?'	2.9920367149841773
'She could see him instantly before\nher, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more\nsubstantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and\nthe regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.'	2.9921120230549447
'I know you do; and it is  that  which makes the wonder.'	2.99232316320848
'Mr Bingley had not been of\nage two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to\nlook at Netherfield House.'	2.9924903913498375
'I thought it my duty\nto give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and\nher noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run\nhastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.'	2.9930657744316207
'But Mr Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours\nin the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in\nher hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till\ndinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the\nhousekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.'	2.9931226365619046
"His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an\nadmiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded\nElizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his\nown, would be speedily secured."	2.9937934546829084
"Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so\nfavourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost\nsure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon."	2.993911060820007
'And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater\nbeauty.'	2.994224630862193
'Every idea that had been brought\nforward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she\nstood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes\nupon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of\ngratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and\nsoftened its impropriety of expression.'	2.994312227920423
'Jane resolutely\nkept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went\nto the window--she looked,--she saw Mr Darcy with him, and sat down\nagain by her sister.'	2.9945631015536445
'And to be kept back on  such  a motive!--I think it\nwould not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of\nmind.'	2.9946358222823433
'It was not all settled before Monday:'	2.994785321683597
'In the absence of Jane,\nhe always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of\nher; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of\nrelief.'	2.9948836684157136
'Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to\nacknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it.'	2.9949655211258333
'That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other\ninducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny.'	2.9950150707751977
'It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we\ncannot escape the acquaintance now.'	2.9958392838134444
'Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\ndisgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\nespecially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing\nat her sister and Bingley,) shall take place.'	2.995896042739881
'Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his\ntime here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.'	2.996031681460316
'I hope,  said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the\nnext day,  you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this\ndesirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;\nand if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after\nthe officers.--And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to\ncheck that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,\nwhich your lady possesses.'	2.9963432417422853
"Your sister I also watched.--Her look and\n     manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any\n     symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the\n     evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with\n     pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of\n     sentiment.--If  you  have not been mistaken here,  I  must have\n     been in an error."	2.9963820787358575
'The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be\nrequited.'	2.9965579485518643
'But do not imagine\nthat he is always here so often.'	2.9966846429987952
'You know I always\nspeak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling\npost by themselves.'	2.996816448490218
"They were all astonished; and Mr Bennet, who could by no means wish for\nso speedy a return, immediately said,\n\n But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my\ngood sir?--You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of\noffending your patroness."	2.9969786931914255
'But above all, above respect and esteem,\nthere was a motive within her of good will which could not be\noverlooked.'	2.9974497914165132
'I know of nobody that is coming I am sure,\nunless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope  my  dinners\nare good enough for her.'	2.9988707045772154
'And you are\nnever to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten\nminutes of every day in a rational manner.'	2.9990881851975066
'The apothecary came, and having\nexamined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a\nviolent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;\nadvised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.'	2.999213223665817
"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,\nand pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful\nlittle design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss\nGrantley's."	2.999346407630155
'Elizabeth was watchful enough to\nsee it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.'	2.999635825615138
'CHAPTER V.\n\n\n I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,  said her uncle, as they\ndrove from the town;  and really, upon serious consideration, I am much\nmore inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the\nmatter.'	3.0001958743361103
'You and the girls may go, or you may send\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are\nas handsome as any of them, Mr Bingley might like you the best of the\nparty.'	3.000242325337334
"Mr\nBennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage\nbefore Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr Bingley\nand his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very\nwell.--Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively\nresolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the\ncontrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,\nshe urged Jane to borrow Mr Bingley's carriage immediately, and at\nlength it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield\nthat morning should be mentioned, and the request made."	3.000420128616592
'He heard her attentively, and then said,\n\n Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public\nplace or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little\nexpense or inconvenience to her family as under the present\ncircumstances.'	3.000556808158768
'This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of\nMr Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,\ntherefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent\nmatters till they reached the parsonage.'	3.0007244206642776
'She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to\nhim she had hardly courage to speak.'	3.000742757153897
"Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting, that had\nshe chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her\nfuture niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her\nladyship's indignation would have been."	3.001090426540294
'She resolved to give her the information herself, and\ntherefore charged Mr Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner,\nto drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.'	3.001200885049963
"Had his own happiness, however, been\nthe only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what\never manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she\nthought he must be sensible himself."	3.001394524982508
'In the desperation\nof her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to\nElizabeth, said,\n\n Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a\nturn about the room.--I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting\nso long in one attitude.'	3.001595692417765
'I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and\nwill save all the best of the covies for you.'	3.0030450364901156
'The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their\nrelationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore\nit; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he\ncould from such disgraceful companions.'	3.003548876355577
'I need not explain myself farther; and\n     though  we  know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she\n     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so\n     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may\n     feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable.'	3.004225510837435
"Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\nwithout anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried\nhim through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the\ntruth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the\nmost forbearing courtesy."	3.004650406622335
'She was not sorry, however, to\nhave the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from\nwhom they sprung.'	3.0050847607890723
'While Sir William was with them, Mr Collins devoted his mornings\nto driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he\nwent away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and\nElizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin\nby the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and\ndinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading\nand writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which\nfronted the road.'	3.0052894341467202
'I should be sorry to think so\nill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.'	3.0053184230299284
'He\nbore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that\nBingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes\nlikewise turned towards Mr Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing\nalarm.'	3.0053894585042853
'In her own past\nbehaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in\nthe unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.'	3.0056394284180565
'You have only proved by this,  cried Elizabeth,  that Mr Bingley did\nnot do justice to his own disposition.'	3.0067717000813095
'She was teazed by\nMr Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he\ncould not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her\npower to dance with others.'	3.0070522564899194
'After discharging\nhis conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many\nrapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection\nof their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was\nmerely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready\nto close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither\nhe hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,\nhe added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take\nplace as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable\nargument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him\nthe happiest of men.'	3.0070963916236404
'I knew it to be a\nmost respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me\nfarther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great\nattentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.'	3.0077013562257164
'We must not expect a lively young man\nto be always so guarded and circumspect.'	3.008413261275062
'It does not often happen\nthat the interference of friends will persuade a young man of\nindependent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in\nlove with only a few days before.'	3.0084816107269203
'He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure\n I  never want to see him again.'	3.008812147073771
'I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared\n     something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock\n     is over, shall I own that I long for your return?'	3.0093046978320195
"He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their\naunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was\nwell talked over.--To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged\nthat the necessity of his absence  had  been self imposed."	3.0093526832913366
"It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger\ndaughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of\nother rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be\nable to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that\nshe might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked."	3.010223502148772
'I have been meditating on the very great pleasure\nwhich a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.'	3.010345739142133
'And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that\nwould not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.'	3.0106167493187157
'Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to\nthe utmost to speak with composure when she said,\n\n You are mistaken, Mr Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your\ndeclaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the\nconcern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a\nmore gentleman-like manner.'	3.0106848168072524
'Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for\nwhile he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else;\nbut she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those\nhours of separation that must sometimes occur.'	3.0115119135926522
'No one but Mr Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and\nshe made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and\nhaving very frequent parties at home.'	3.0125579171298327
'Wherever you and Jane are known,\nyou must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less\nadvantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three very silly\nsisters.'	3.0129287973185166
'It was in the Times and the Courier, I know;\nthough it was not put in as it ought to be.'	3.0134826478855246
"The present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for\nthe lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be\nfairly conjectured from  that , though Elizabeth, who was by this time\ntolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware,\nthat, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of\nLydia's infamy somewhat better."	3.0135489680504315
"At one time she had almost resolved on applying to\nhim, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and\nat length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr Darcy would never\nhave hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his\ncousin's corroboration."	3.0137513000256018
'Mr Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to\nintroduce his friend, Mr Wickham, who had returned with him the day\nbefore from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in\ntheir corps.'	3.0137744621194775
'She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but\nshe could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and\ncold was their manner, whenever they did.'	3.0138138629762743
"Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but\nshe could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no\nlonger mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,\nit was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without\nmuch reluctance."	3.0142511312113336
"She enquired into Charlotte's domestic\nconcerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice,\nas to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be\nregulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the\ncare of her cows and her poultry."	3.014257126431956
'I am afraid you do not like your pen.'	3.0145889623313824
'But as to your\nother objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.'	3.015102140024755
'Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he\ncould not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at\nbeing spoke to.'	3.0151245348536198
"When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr\nCollins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much\nstruck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he\nmight almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour\nat Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much\ngratification; but when Mr Philips understood from him what Rosings\nwas, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the\ndescription of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found\nthat the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all\nthe force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison\nwith the housekeeper's room."	3.0154010637433237
'and turning round, he looked for a moment at\nElizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said,\n She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt  me ; and I am in no\nhumour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted\nby other men.'	3.0157073516845303
'I am not ashamed of having been\nmistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of\nwhat I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.'	3.016080820050866
'And one of my\nown daughters.'	3.0160988366849333
'When first Mr Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly\nuseless; for, of course, they were to have a son.'	3.01620360993775
'He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing\nwith her himself, attended to her conversation with others.'	3.016284525296035
"The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most\nremarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself\nagreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than\nin Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence."	3.016543682517663
'It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.'	3.016656691765591
'In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been\ntoo busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their\nappearance before.'	3.0177729865333665
'He only meant that there were not\nsuch a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which\nyou must acknowledge to be true.'	3.0179402165693765
"Mr\nBingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but\nsince he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt\nthe rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of\nboth gentlemen as I did before."	3.018519430948316
'How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,\nshe could not imagine.'	3.018761862283193
"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in\n     her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have\n     been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me."	3.0195204315072903
'CHAPTER IV.\n\n\nElizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from\nJane, on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had\nbeen renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but\non the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the\nreceipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that\nit had been missent elsewhere.'	3.019656206672904
'As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass\nbetween the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or\nboth, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such\nbehaviour than her sister.'	3.0199692638581537
'The chief of every day was spent by\nhim at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time\nto make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.'	3.0202903910134156
"The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had\nbeen, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same\nkind of supposition, which had appeased Mr Bennet's curiosity; and\nElizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject."	3.021364208158927
'But she is too much like her brother,--very,\nvery proud.--As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and\nextremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her\namusement.'	3.021454651188032
'In a few minutes, Mr Bennet half opened the door and called out,\n\n Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.'	3.02202732874223
'She shared in their attendance on Mr Bennet, and was a\ngreat comfort to them, in their hours of freedom.'	3.0221122213286895
"But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,\nhe was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;\nand, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her\nresentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity\nto see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on\nthem at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had\nreceived, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the\nvisits of her uncle and aunt from the city."	3.0231753437498785
'What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself\non having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most\nimprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other\nparticulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him\nthe kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from\nknowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.'	3.023266371190695
'We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the\nmore anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that\nwhen there has been  one  intermarriage, she may have less trouble in\nachieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I\ndare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.'	3.023460715867258
'I owe all that I know\nof it, to another, not to you.'	3.023608664855899
'But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down\nwithout one of her sisters.'	3.0236487094026288
'At such a time, much might\nhave been said, and silence was very awkward.'	3.023715318515654
'But before she had been three minutes in her own room,\nher mother followed her.'	3.0239471151492725
'At such a moment, the arrival of her friend\nwas a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their\nmeetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she\nsaw Mr Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her\nhusband.'	3.0245155267555925
"Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by\nwhat he said of Mr Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but\nwonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of\nhis seeing too  little , she might have fancied too  much ."	3.0247473431203566
'It was a subject which they could not mention before me.'	3.0249546780444256
'She is a most charming young lady indeed.'	3.025116812361157
'It has been my own doing,\nand I ought to feel it.'	3.0252145967434845
"But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,\neven to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various\nconjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from\nthe difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable\nfrom the time of year."	3.0252176620847173
'What could be the meaning of it?--It was impossible to imagine; it was\nimpossible not to long to know.'	3.0257406058057508
"She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an\ninmate of Mr Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of\nthe latter with regard to new furniture."	3.0258015688673012
'His present pursuit could not make him forget that\nElizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the\nfirst to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner\nof bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what\nshe was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their\nopinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide,\nthere was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her\nto him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced,\nthat whether married or single, he must always be her model of the\namiable and pleasing.'	3.025900446087037
'Could she have seen half as much love in Mr Darcy\nfor herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.'	3.0261343238715415
'From what she had said of her resolution to\nprevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate\nan application to her nephew; and how  he  might take a similar\nrepresentation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared\nnot pronounce.'	3.0265057406433518
'But no\nsooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had\nhardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\nuncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.'	3.0265116187689105
'It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not\nvisit them.'	3.026778545398257
'From this day you must\nbe a stranger to one of your parents.--Your mother will never see you\nagain if you do  not  marry Mr Collins, and I will never see you again\nif you  do .'	3.0271442225431717
'Elizabeth\nwas ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated\nbetween Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in\nlistening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all\ndinner time.'	3.027179897601869
'My mother means well;\nbut she does not know, no one can know how much I suffer from what she\nsays.'	3.028695772011847
'She immediately felt\nthat whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,\nmust be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was\nsatisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made\nhim think really ill of her.'	3.02875030965253
"Elizabeth, for the sake of\nsaying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if\nCharlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since  her  coming away."	3.0292776751494195
'Many of my acquaintance are\nalready there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest\nfriend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I\ndespair.'	3.029476501369151
'Jane was anxious that no\ndifference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded\nthat she talked as much as ever.'	3.0301841393772806
'When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley\nbegan abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.'	3.030357743945576
'Very true, indeed;--and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in\nbehalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the\nbusiness?--Do clear  them  too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of\nsomebody.'	3.0306109138619184
'When those dances\nwere over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with\nher, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr Darcy, who took\nher so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without\nknowing what she did, she accepted him.'	3.0315074583807777
'On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two,\nwho were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as\nsportsmen, were in very good time.'	3.0315425148280752
'The subject elevated him\nto more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect\nhe protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a\nperson of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself\nexperienced from Lady Catherine.'	3.031644059930975
'Do you not consider that a connection with you,\nmust disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?'	3.0318245237045796
'His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr Collins was walking\nthe whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,\nin order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow\nas the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great\nintelligence.'	3.0323420844763858
'But against this, there were objections; and she finally\nresolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as\nto the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.'	3.0325004827545037
'There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he\nis disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to\ndiscourage him.'	3.0326639498826276
"Mr Darcy's\nshameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a\nkeener sense of her sister's sufferings."	3.0329128151617297
'But I am\nafraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means\nintend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a\ncircumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I\ncould.'	3.033135105518781
'Mr Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mr Philips, and\n she  ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her\nneighbours in Meryton.'	3.033285388924428
'On the contrary she was as much disposed to\ncomplain of it as her husband.--It was very strange that he should come\nto Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient\nand exceedingly troublesome.--She hated having visitors in the house\nwhile her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the\nmost disagreeable.'	3.0335431922138043
'I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for\nPurvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.'	3.0339887342251117
'yes,  said Elizabeth drily-- Mr Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr\nBingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.'	3.0347366101473883
'They soon outstripped the others, and when they had\nreached the carriage, Mr and Mr Gardiner were half a quarter of a\nmile behind.'	3.034789157374596
'as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended\nthere was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if\nKitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we\nbehaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest\ncold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have\ntreated you too.'	3.035247624254446
'But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr\nBingley, if he  had been  imposed on, would have much to suffer when the\naffair became public.'	3.0357424023871307
'Mr Collins was carefully instructing them in\nwhat they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many\nservants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.'	3.0358621178073464
'But you do not know  all .'	3.036083924090459
'She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and\nturned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly\nsurmount even in speaking to Mr Bingley, whose blind partiality\nprovoked her.'	3.0363412940444223
'Only think of  that  my dear; he actually danced with her\ntwice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second\ntime.'	3.0363852339915445
'I dare say you will find him very agreeable.'	3.0366895056755463
'Miss Bennet,  replied her ladyship, in an angry tone,  you ought to\nknow, that I am not to be trifled with.'	3.036792251587253
'Had Elizabeth\nbeen able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the\nexpression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him;\nbut, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of\nfeelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his\naffection every moment more valuable.'	3.0368003734738798
'I  should be\nashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.'	3.0368826361408288
"In no countenance was attentive\ncuriosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the\nsmiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\nobjects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\nto Mr Darcy were by no means over."	3.0369598255447015
'Mr Gardiner would be prevented by business from\nsetting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again\nwithin a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so\nfar, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with\nthe leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up\nthe Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the\npresent plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire.'	3.0370605767406054
'She will be down in a moment I dare say.'	3.037072475440575
'It was\nimpossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its\nowner.'	3.037558485893231
'It was absolutely\nnecessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence\nrecollecting  when  she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling\ncurious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty\ndeparture, she observed,\n\n How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr Darcy!'	3.038187735966536
'He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to\nmake any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was\nstruck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to\nher,\n\n My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing?--Mr Darcy, you must allow\nme to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.--You\ncannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.'	3.0382598237400287
'The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold\nin his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what\nwe shall do.'	3.0384274142134027
'Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first\nconvenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,\n\n You mean to frighten me, Mr Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear\nme?'	3.0384582914022635
'Well, and so just\nas the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business\nto that horrid man Mr Stone.'	3.038543689075039
"Occupied in observing Mr Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth\nwas far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some\ninterest in the eyes of his friend."	3.038688482665495
'He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say\nthat he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I\nparticularly begged him to do.'	3.038795919464228
'On finding\nMr Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon\nafter breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,\n\n May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,\nwhen I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the\ncourse of this morning?'	3.039374063324459
'But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an\nhour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her\nimpatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he\ndid not come back, she should think herself very ill used.'	3.039540840614205
'Her ladyship seemed pleased\nwith the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to\noffer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to\nladies.'	3.0396348031553972
"They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mr Bennet, in\nthe meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good\nhumour, and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had\nrevived."	3.039784777485887
'Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,\nturned silently away.'	3.040792511985788
'If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,\n he  was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that\nJane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.'	3.0412146863510503
'Tell him I hope he will\n     excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at\n     the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.'	3.0422811388644804
'But she is very young; she has never\nbeen taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,\nnay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement\nand vanity.'	3.042505421233829
'But his pride, his abominable pride, his\nshameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his\nunpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it,\nand the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr Wickham, his\ncruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the\npity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.'	3.0425120017202465
'Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as\nhis leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having\nno feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the\nmoment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the\nobservances which he supposed a regular part of the business.'	3.042859217168106
'It\nwas spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr Collins joining\nin, observed,\n\n Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine\nde Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will\nbe delighted with her.'	3.0430618650929278
'They are young in the ways\nof the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that\nhandsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the\nplain.'	3.044268604524725
'If you and Miss\nBennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very\nthankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.'	3.0443152581208417
'I do not know any body who seems\nmore to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr Darcy.'	3.044366584301705
'They had been walking about the\nplace with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn\nto dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a\ncarriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a\ncurricle, driving up the street.'	3.045030399525056
'For a few moments, indeed,\nshe felt that he would probably strike into some other path.'	3.0453833679900915
'I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak\nwhat I think.'	3.0464674708517396
"CHAPTER VII.\n\n\nTwo days after Mr Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking\ntogether in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper\ncoming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their\nmother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,\nwhen they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet,  I beg your pardon,\nmadam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some\ngood news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask."	3.0469107410259015
'Such a\nchange in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but\ngratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such\nits impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means\nunpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.'	3.0471277767768865
'She did not choose it,  said her daughter,  she would go.'	3.0479640326101305
'It is not\nof peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining.'	3.0487539942715234
'And you may be certain that when I have the honour of\nseeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,\neconomy, and other amiable qualifications.'	3.0488125435635443
'Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my\nopinion.'	3.0493229759748646
'Let me take it\nin the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.'	3.049880361415527
'The idea of Mr Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away\nwith by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not\nuse the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and\nhe continued:'	3.050869441926062
'I do not cough for my own amusement,  replied Kitty fretfully.'	3.0509615689887615
'Elizabeth did all she could, to shield\nhim from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him\nto herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse\nwithout mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising\nfrom all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it\nadded to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to\nthe time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to\neither, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at\nPemberley.'	3.051223519294802
'The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly\nwhat he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr Darcy,\nthough she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his\nown words.'	3.0514786455597402
'I can remember no symptom of affection on either\nside; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware\nthat ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away.'	3.0516462606812147
"In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely\nawed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage\nenough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;\nand his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge\nof her chair, not knowing which way to look."	3.0516497778855083
'The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,\nthe Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its\nengagement.'	3.0518014326092926
'It was next to impossible that their cousin should\ncome in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had\nreceived pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.'	3.0520666896801214
"He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went\naway, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mr\nBennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband."	3.05240356998275
'But it is all, all too late now.'	3.0532952387569106
"A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to\nElizabeth; but at last on Mr Bennet's leaving them together, after a\nlonger irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could\nnot help saying,\n\n Oh!"	3.0534958186622534
'After sitting long enough to admire every\narticle of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to\ngive an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London,\nMr Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large\nand well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.'	3.0535793825559177
'However, I\nrecollected afterwards, that if he  had  been prevented going, the\nwedding need not be put off, for Mr Darcy might have done as well.'	3.0537094984793547
'This observation would not have prevented her\nfrom trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an\ninconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity\nof saying much.'	3.0540524400010187
'Her tour to the Lakes\nwas now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation\nfor all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her\nmother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in\nthe scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.'	3.054101195703457
'She received him with\nher very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,\napologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with\nher, which he could not help flattering himself however might be\njustified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to\nher notice.'	3.0547761586865096
'Nor was it under many, many minutes, that\nshe could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to\ncredit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the\nshape of a lover to any of them.'	3.0563487250938532
'She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in\na voice which proved it to be Mr Darcy, she moved again towards the\ngate.'	3.056404188023253
'No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her\nacceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.'	3.056984761346431
'This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted\nonly regimentals to make him completely charming.'	3.057221570725557
"She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to\nbe made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that  she ,\nhis favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be\nfilling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched\nreflection, and she sat in misery till Mr Darcy appeared again, when,\nlooking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile."	3.0577455120680677
'This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but\nMr Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,\n\n You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may\nprove so; for else they will be destitute enough.'	3.0579322765749444
'While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether\nshe most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr Darcy, by the\nfeelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but\na moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to\nregret that he came.'	3.058118708187293
'He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that\nbusiness with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours\nbefore the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.'	3.058312191059418
'Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr and Mr Collins sat\ndown to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the\ntwo girls had the honour of assisting Mr Jenkinson to make up her\nparty.'	3.058710655408117
"Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had\nsomething to say to him before he had advanced many steps."	3.0587438125356394
'--said Jane faintly smiling,-- You must know that\nthough I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could\nnot hesitate.'	3.0591008983147283
'She had been graciously pleased to\napprove of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of\npreaching before her.'	3.0596031238344716
"To these high\nflown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of\ndistrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she\nsaw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their\nabsence from Netherfield would prevent Mr Bingley's being there; and as\nto the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon\ncease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his."	3.0596350247532316
'Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what\nshe did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely\nthe effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw\nher no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at\nthe time, she had the same story to repeat every day.'	3.0600589654844814
'He concluded with\nrepresenting to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of\nall his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with\nexpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of\nhis hand.'	3.060203812420048
'It would be dreadful!'	3.061204781641685
"Not that I am afraid\nof  myself , but I dread other people's remarks."	3.061243458145247
'Mr Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine\nthere, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did\nnot think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a\nman, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and\npride of one who had ten thousand a-year.'	3.0612587351110663
"Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare\nthat Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she\nis perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she\nsuspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to\nput me on my guard?"	3.062121328700409
"There is but one part of my conduct in the\n     whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is\n     that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to\n     conceal from him your sister's being in town."	3.0630967452046307
'By tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr Bennet was glad to\ntake his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad\nto invite him to read aloud to the ladies.'	3.0632640332054732
'The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this\nconversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom\nthey had been speaking; Mr Bingley and his sisters came to give their\npersonal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was\nfixed for the following Tuesday.'	3.0641920455484524
'But I wonder how long you\n would  have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.'	3.0645506754655796
'And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to\n     suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness\n     of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree\n     of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of\n     yourself and Mr Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own\n     disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of\n     such an enormity, at so early an age.'	3.0652959942840394
'If\nthat had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.'	3.065756863817053
'Charlotte the wife of Mr Collins,\nwas a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing\nherself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction\nthat it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot\nshe had chosen.'	3.0657959838625266
'If you love Mr Darcy half as well as I do my dear\n     Wickham, you must be very happy.'	3.0662014719926294
"Now was the\nmoment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was\nhigh, she immediately said,\n\n Mr Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving\nrelief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your's."	3.067109548695207
"CHAPTER XVI.\n\n\nAs no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their\naunt, and all Mr Collins's scruples of leaving Mr and Mr Bennet for\na single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach\nconveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the\ngirls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,\nthat Mr Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in\nthe house."	3.0681105673685205
'They repulsed\nevery attempt of Mr Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a\nlanguor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the\nlong speeches of Mr Collins, who was complimenting Mr Bingley and his\nsisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and\npoliteness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.'	3.0682376220849967
'Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but\ntheir visit to Rosings.'	3.069530876134152
'About a month,  said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject\ndrop, added,  He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I\nunderstand.'	3.0707340643919316
'said she,  I heard you before; but I could not immediately\ndetermine what to say in reply.'	3.070973804974672
"I want to be told whether I\nought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand\nWickham's character."	3.0713832347332386
'Well,  said Charlotte,  I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if\nshe were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a\nchance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a\ntwelvemonth.'	3.0714448712442657
'And so, my dear sister, I find from our uncle and aunt, that\nyou have actually seen Pemberley.'	3.0721204768987715
"He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's\nrecollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen\nhim often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man,\nasked her how she had liked him."	3.072193322388542
'Her younger\nsisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness\nwhich she might in future be able to dispense.'	3.072895767765202
'But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort\nfor it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect\nof their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished\nher all imaginable happiness.'	3.0732866173867404
'Sir William could not have\ninterrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for\nthemselves.--We have tried two or three subjects already without\nsuccess, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.'	3.073290075769492
"On\nMr and Mr Gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the\nhouse and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted\non each side with the utmost politeness."	3.073678557016667
'He\nfound her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as\nunaffected, though not quite so chatty.'	3.0742346147903477
'Mr and Mr Collins have a comfortable income, but not\nsuch a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my\nfriend would not call herself  near  her family under less than  half \nthe present distance.'	3.0751494168266347
'I have no pleasure in\ntalking to undutiful children.--Not that I have much pleasure indeed in\ntalking to any body.'	3.0751850176006768
'It was greatly my wish that he should do so,  he added,  as soon\n     as his marriage was fixed on.'	3.075742765288322
"The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her\nstory, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a\nreproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon\nregained her composure, and calmly replied,\n\n Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible\nthat Mr Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,\nbecause he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"	3.0760740216833984
'and it was not wholly without foundation.'	3.0765141974430508
'I am not at all afraid of her dying.'	3.0766000099619837
'I assure\nyou that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with\nmyself, I should not pay him half so much deference.'	3.077532331578455
'She longed to\nspeak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mr\nBennet began repeating her thanks to Mr Bingley for his kindness to\nJane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy.'	3.0776567636278096
"I have not a doubt of Mr Bingley's sincerity,  said Elizabeth warmly;\n but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only."	3.077760697678007
'When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,\nand made the important communication.'	3.0778038022279635
"Her thoughts were instantly\ndriven back to the time when Mr Bingley's name had been last mentioned\nbetween them; and if she might judge from his complexion,  his  mind was\nnot very differently engaged."	3.0781666320449617
"This, she would not hear of; but she was not so\nunwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled\nthat Mr Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet\nwere not decidedly better."	3.078458722365081
'With a stronger voice she soon added,  I have this comfort immediately,\nthat it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it\nhas done no harm to any one but myself.'	3.0795893127428506
'He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard\nthem from Mr Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to\nhim  conditionally  only.'	3.0796202438614224
'I have no reason, I assure you,  said he,  to be dissatisfied with my\nreception.'	3.079635239367055
'Mr Wickham\nhad received his commission before he left London, and he was to join\nhis regiment at the end of a fortnight.'	3.0796358529301417
"On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,\nwhose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to\nwait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her\nfor a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower."	3.0797139501790105
'I have therefore made up my mind to tell\nyou, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if\nyou dare.'	3.0797629857951447
'Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth\nagain, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to\nmake after all their Hertfordshire friends.'	3.079772026757263
'It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr Darcy himself; but,\nwhenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general\ncomplaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far\nremoved from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that\nthe improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however\ntemporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.'	3.0800584953169654
'He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down\nthe dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often\nwalk to Meryton.'	3.0806397391583102
'Mr Hurst and Mr Bingley were at piquet, and\nMr Hurst was observing their game.'	3.081033382072304
'And rising as she thus\nspoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr Collins thus\naddressed her,\n\n When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I\nshall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given\nme; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I\nknow it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the\nfirst application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to\nencourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the\nfemale character.'	3.0813578485453323
'It\nwas, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own\nwishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved\nhim, as now, when all love must be vain.'	3.0816448032219927
"Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the\nmelancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there\nhimself."	3.0824914459956703
'His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr Darcy, was one of the best men\nthat ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be\nin company with this Mr Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\nthousand tender recollections.'	3.082899252746905
'He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them\ndressed.'	3.084072761459446
'From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my\nacquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest\nbelief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the\nfeelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of\ndisapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a\ndislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the\nlast man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.'	3.0846313614315704
'When Mr Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he\nsent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon\nas the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn.'	3.0853481955932485
'They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mr\nBennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail\nbitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of\nfive daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.'	3.086083789415787
'As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than\nthe last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not\nlong enough to determine her feelings towards  one  in that mansion; and\nshe lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out.'	3.0864439723612023
'I cannot see why Mr Forster should not ask  me  as well as Lydia, \nsaid she,  though I am  not  her particular friend.'	3.086822952941387
'my dear father, can you\nsuppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever\nthey are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the\ndisgrace?'	3.0870720366922777
'Were it known to the rest\nof my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.'	3.087229710774091
'The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great\nfor her to know in what manner she acceded to it.'	3.087235257778189
"The first mentioned\n     was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached\n     Mr Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in\n     defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,\n     ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr\n     Wickham.--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of\n     my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who\n     had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who\n     had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,\n     to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could\n     be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--But\n     from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally\n     bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in\n     future secured, when the following account of my actions and their\n     motives has been read.--If, in the explanation of them which is\n     due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which\n     may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry.--The\n     necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--I\n     had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with\n     others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other\n     young woman in the country.--But it was not till the evening of the\n     dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a\n     serious attachment.--I had often seen him in love before.--At that\n     ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made\n     acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that\n     Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general\n     expectation of their marriage."	3.0873522057848177
'His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but\nthough he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no\nmeans unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mr Hurst, who had\nmarried a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider\nhis house as her home when it suited her.'	3.087674589773729
'It is a pity they are not handsome!'	3.0877571981864254
'This information, however, startled Mr Bennet;--she would have been\nglad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage\nhim by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe\nit, and could not help saying so.'	3.088353626504926
'The suspicions which had just\narisen of Mr Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards\neach with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from\nthose enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what\nit was to love.'	3.0884069330004618
'But I am particularly\nattached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to\nme!--They were excessively sorry to go!'	3.0893970199231164
'Well, Monday morning came, and I was in\nsuch a fuss!'	3.0895024243288227
'She had scarcely needed her\npresent observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that\ntheir elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather\nthan by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring\nfor her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain\nthat his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and\nif that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity\nof having a companion.'	3.089544036511256
'The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have\na daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as\nmuch entailed as ever.'	3.0897005726972093
'When they sat down to\nsupper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which\nplaced them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find\nthat her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,\nopenly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be\nsoon married to Mr Bingley.--It was an animating subject, and Mr\nBennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of\nthe match.'	3.091498178626871
'He\nhad always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his\nwife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was\npaid, she had no knowledge of it.'	3.092417049325428
'Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her\nbrain; but she was satisfied with none.'	3.0924928493351387
'I happened to overhear the\ngentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of\nthis house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother\nLady Catherine.'	3.0930211389336617
'After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with\n\n It is  your  turn to say something now, Mr Darcy.-- I  talked about\nthe dance, and  you  ought to make some kind of remark on the size of\nthe room, or the number of couples.'	3.0932045132058588
'I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her\nkindness on a more grateful object.'	3.093353138022408
"Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her\nfather's behaviour as a husband."	3.094119205336603
'I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more.'	3.094603840197598
'He knows of my\n     being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and\n     yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to\n     persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy.'	3.0960296085683088
"Mr Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such\nas he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for\nit gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had\nbeen used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and\nmore foolish than his daughter!"	3.096117586734199
'To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had\nbeen asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his\nrepeating it.'	3.0963580792134704
'He is as fine a fellow,  said Mr Bennet, as soon as they were out of\nthe house,  as ever I saw.'	3.096377907211589
"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am?"	3.0968607746306467
'She could not imagine what business he could have in town\nso soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that\nhe might be always flying about from one place to another, and never\nsettled at Netherfield as he ought to be.'	3.0980537319890056
'I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very\n     much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live\n     upon without some help.'	3.0981333108446916
"Lydia's being settled in the\nNorth, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her\ncompany, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in\nHertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a\npity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted\nwith every body, and had so many favourites."	3.0983064478643785
'The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,\nand who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he\ntold her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.'	3.0984995509918454
'It was many months since she had mentioned his name to\nElizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,\n\n I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present\nreport; and I know I appeared distressed.'	3.0988998447411458
"They could\nnot be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character\nfrom their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference\nto any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known,\nwould not have recognised it for Mr Darcy."	3.099018661390567
'that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!'	3.099629416523463
'He did every\nthing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on\nthe first of September, than any body else in the country.'	3.1007374784946204
'She was sure they should be married some time or\n     other, and it did not much signify when.'	3.1008771358701286
'In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,  said Bingley;  and\nI hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.'	3.1009509391570886
'But here he was set right by Mr Bennet, who assured\nhim with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good\ncook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.'	3.100978315226879
'said Elizabeth.'	3.10108163157065
'said Elizabeth.'	3.10108163157065
'When my niece Georgiana went to\nRamsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men servants go\nwith her.--Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady\nAnne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--I\nam excessively attentive to all those things.'	3.1015027076477577
'And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be\nBingley.'	3.1020579143934204
'I wonder,  said he, at the next opportunity of speaking,  whether he is\nlikely to be in this country much longer.'	3.102521206104891
'He protested that except Lady\nCatherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for\nshe had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even\npointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although\nutterly unknown to her before.'	3.102624456916748
'Elizabeth\nwas surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme,\nand, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him\nwould have been the last object of her wishes.'	3.103411832057541
'But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been\n     acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her\n     brother is the cause of it.'	3.103428080866551
'She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her\nhusband, called out as she entered the library,\n\n Oh!'	3.1039983071811075
'In that\ncounty, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three\nweeks; and to Mr Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.'	3.1041886135684065
'Kitty and me were to spend\nthe day there, and Mr Forster promised to have a little dance in the\nevening; (by the bye, Mr Forster and me are  such  friends!) and so\nshe asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen\nwas forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?'	3.1042568158940846
'She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell\nher, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner\nconnected with the letter he held.'	3.1054970235148263
'That he should even speak to\nher was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her\nfamily!'	3.1055576509721217
'He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family,\nand looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever\ndone.'	3.1064256662333447
'It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.'	3.1073335768625476
'All this was acknowledged to Mr Gardiner; and after relating the\ncircumstances, she thus went on:-- I am now convinced, my dear aunt,\nthat I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that\npure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,\nand wish him all manner of evil.'	3.1074296088929168
'She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that\nLydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had\nwanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body.'	3.107583577797051
'But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little\nsoftened by his manner of expressing himself.'	3.1083569372349507
"Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her\nhusband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her\nneighbours might all see Mr Bingley in consequence of it, before  they \ndid."	3.1085833626594264
'Indeed I do not dare.'	3.1089038641193216
"Well, any friend of\nMr Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else I must\nsay that I hate the very sight of him."	3.109454217455676
'Her resistance had not\ninjured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some\ncomplacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,\n\n I can guess the subject of your reverie.'	3.109914602605788
'Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter\nand fainter; and in farther justification of Mr Darcy, she could not\nbut allow that Mr Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago\nasserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as\nwere his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their\nacquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much\ntogether, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing\nthat betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him\nof irreligious or immoral habits.'	3.1105652497793472
"I know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a\npatched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles."	3.111172503019507
"Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last\nvery rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,\nafter assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to\nsee her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most\ntenderly, she even shook hands with the former.--Elizabeth took leave of\nthe whole party in the liveliest spirits."	3.111512072778213
'That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she\nhad ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she\ncould not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness\nof temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave\nof his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to\nthe caprice of their inclinations.'	3.1117612145626454
'If I,  said Mr Collins,  were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I\nshould have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an\nair; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly\ncompatible with the profession of a clergyman.--I do not mean however to\nassert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to\nmusic, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.'	3.112158387285132
'Mr Collins was also in the same state of angry pride.'	3.1122506029229995
"She answered him in the usual\nway, and after a moment's pause, added,\n\n My eldest sister has been in town these three months."	3.1124645318097355
"But, perhaps he could not in her mother's\npresence be what he was before her uncle and aunt."	3.1126919880814494
'What Wickham had said of the living\nwas fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was\nimpossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the\nother; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did\nnot err.'	3.1128289814864503
'Mr Gardiner, who was several years younger than\nMr Bennet and Mr Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant\nwoman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces.'	3.1137266398689203
'She felt that she had no business at\nPemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.'	3.115256222733076
'I told him, moreover, that I believed myself\nmistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent\nto him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was\nunabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.'	3.1153138885614626
'Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier\ngirls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him,\nthere had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted\nwith all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel\nmore beautiful.'	3.115335891091066
"She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his\nbeing partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mr\nCollins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of\nraising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her\nopinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would\nvanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power."	3.1154302317468776
'Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the\nnext day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr\nWickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\nwould come in the evening.'	3.116642243076286
'You will not be fit to be seen when you get\nthere.'	3.1171891373808407
'Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to\nmarry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had\na wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found\nthem as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.'	3.1186175679820187
'Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,\nand nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during\nthese visits.'	3.1187322393316927
"Wickham, perhaps,\nis my favourite; but I think I shall like  your  husband quite as well\nas Jane's."	3.1187697211421495
'CHAPTER VI.\n\n\nThe whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr Bennet the next\nmorning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.'	3.118955926157677
'What\n     he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress\n     will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest\n     way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again\n     to-morrow evening.'	3.119358829105214
'That his two sisters and Mr Darcy, however, should\nhave such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and\nshe could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or\nthe insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.'	3.119413254432883
'Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a\ngreat opposition of character.--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the\neasiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could\noffer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never\nappeared dissatisfied.'	3.119479208252767
'Very few days passed in which Mr Collins did not walk to Rosings, and\nnot many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;\nand till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings\nto be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many\nhours.'	3.1198436461264225
'If he does not come to me,  then ,  said she,  I shall give him up for\never.'	3.119895073653692
"Elizabeth, who had a letter\nto write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;\nfor as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be\nwanted to counteract her mother's schemes."	3.121610932356634
"Miss Darcy, on her brother's\nentrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he\nwas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,\nas much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side."	3.1217968845573036
'She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till\nthey were joined by Mr Collins, who entered with an air more stately\nthan usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,\n\n Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and\nlet Mr Collins and me have a little conversation together.'	3.121803514920238
'Your sisters are engaged, and there is not\nanother woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to\nstand up with.'	3.1220603895116703
"Had Miss Bingley known what\npain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have\nrefrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\nElizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed\nher partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in\nDarcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and\nabsurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that\ncorps."	3.122216949250668
'I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much\nfor me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle.'	3.122238468574503
'Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was\nobliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility\nand truth in a few short sentences.'	3.1226569688126378
'As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from\nexciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she\nconsidered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense\nfor the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it\nknown, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her\ngo.'	3.1228245964466375
'If I\nhad known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on\nhim.'	3.1228696073918054
'That would be a good scheme,  said Elizabeth,  if you were sure that\nthey would not offer to send her home.'	3.1234316120277894
'As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of\na favourable answer.'	3.123603820291388
'Lady Lucas quieted her fears a\nlittle by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a\nlarge party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr Bingley\nwas to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.'	3.1241650795079736
'but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and\nwhen I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I\nthink it will be very tolerable.'	3.1247151751457274
'I have not been at all able to account\nfor the honour of seeing you here.'	3.1256732790368504
'She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and\nmother, both of whom had been dead many years.'	3.1263875103484593
"Elizabeth, though she did not credit above\nhalf of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of\nher sister's ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still\nless of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now\ncome, when if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before\nentirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some\nnews of them."	3.1264430345728886
'At length, however, the question was\nasked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mr Reynolds\nreplied, that he was, adding,  but we expect him to-morrow, with a\nlarge party of friends.'	3.1269039414687856
'Do let us have a little music, --cried Miss Bingley, tired of a\nconversation in which she had no share.-- Louisa, you will not mind my\nwaking Mr Hurst.'	3.1269950138902773
"Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to\nme that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could\nnot rest till I knew the particulars."	3.1275330160344135
'The Netherfield\nladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by\ntrade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well\nbred and agreeable.'	3.1276173517132855
'My father and Maria are to come to me in March,  added Charlotte,  and\nI hope you will consent to be of the party.'	3.1276807280375403
'The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the\nworld, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,\nthey had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.'	3.128398146794744
'It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of\n     the kingdom.'	3.1285167799075184
'I  have  heard from authority, which I thought  as good , that it was\nleft you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.'	3.1285771554443613
'Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay.'	3.1285847388544274
'I am very sensible of the honour of\nyour proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline\nthem.'	3.128678171811916
'Lizzy is not a bit better than the\nothers; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\ngood humoured as Lydia.'	3.1289264350395873
'As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned\nher attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr Bingley, and the\ntrain of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,\nmade her perhaps almost as happy as Jane.'	3.1298673485193733
"It soothed,\nbut it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus\nself-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that\nJane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest\nrelations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt\nby such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she\nhad ever known before."	3.130011101344153
'I hardly know how Mr Collins was first introduced to her\nnotice, but he certainly has not known her long.'	3.1310680978481535
'I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her\ncharming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most\nelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by\nher.--These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and\nit is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to\npay.'	3.1324345583297575
"He had rather hoped that all his wife's\nviews on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he\nhad a very different story to hear."	3.1328301183264537
"But Jane and Elizabeth, who\nagreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and\nconsequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,\nurged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her\nand her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was\nprevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished."	3.1329739205507523
'There was too much to\nbe thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects.'	3.1333417302429116
'Had not my own feelings decided\nagainst you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been\nfavourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept\nthe man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the\nhappiness of a most beloved sister?'	3.133392623514404
"They agreed that Mr Bennet should only hear of the departure of the\nfamily, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;\nbut even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,\nand she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen\nto go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together."	3.133659848993934
'CHAPTER XVII.\n\n\n My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?'	3.134505231167532
'my uncle and aunt would have been lost\nto me:'	3.1356578453883026
'As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him\ncome home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult\ntogether as to what is to be done.'	3.1360066300543252
'Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is\nbelieved that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.'	3.136580289972133
'It is from my cousin, Mr Collins, who, when I am dead,\nmay turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.'	3.1366207576104466
'I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with\nyou as ever.'	3.137388189108933
'One ought not to\nrepine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me!'	3.1373954483450714
'Not that I  shall  though,  she added to herself, as she finished the\nletter;  and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable\nmanner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it\nout.'	3.1376823218162855
'Her ladyship received them\ncivilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so\nacceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,\nalmost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,\nmuch more than to any other person in the room.'	3.138038793954254
'In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her\nfeelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily\nperceive that her spirits were affected by it.'	3.138530621597879
"Unwilling as she\nwas to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so\ndishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its\nfrequently recurring."	3.1397225493800427
'It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of\nshort duration.'	3.1398221883907462
'This was one point, with\nregard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr Bennet\ncould have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.'	3.140312023358006
'It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,  said\nBingley.'	3.1415952528059963
"Elizabeth received\nthem with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the\ngentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was\nready to take them all home."	3.141986466936122
'My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so\nmuch?'	3.142476494476766
"Kitty then owned, with a very natural\ntriumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last\nletter, she had prepared her for such a step."	3.1445126076796908
'That had\nhis actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of\nevery thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and\nthat friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man\nas Mr Bingley, was incomprehensible.'	3.1454597782301135
'And with a bow to Mr Darcy, he concluded his speech,\nwhich had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--Many\nstared.--Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr Bennet\nhimself, while his wife seriously commended Mr Collins for having\nspoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that\nhe was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.'	3.146165503855295
'She had been unwilling to\nmention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made\nher equally avoid the name of his friend.'	3.1469311407802008
'She anticipated what would be felt in\nthe family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one\nliked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a\n dislike  which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.'	3.1470387343738504
'It may perhaps be pleasant,  replied Charlotte,  to be able to impose\non the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be\nso very guarded.'	3.1475929332405226
'The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a\nmanoeuvre of Mr Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of\nan hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how\nheartily they were wished away by some of the family.'	3.147894365061979
'It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr Bingley to see you\nall after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day\nbefore.'	3.1483162949578003
"Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like\nman--he is a great friend of Darcy's."	3.1490960070093372
'I told you the other day,\nof his infamous behaviour to Mr Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at\nLongbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved\nwith such forbearance and liberality towards him.'	3.149309769791376
'If you are a good\ngirl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of\nthem.'	3.1498614096613613
'Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of\nspirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that\nshe did not like to go home again so soon, she added,\n\n But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you\nmay stay a little longer.'	3.149913820858462
'I wish I could say any thing to comfort you,  replied Elizabeth;  but\nit is wholly out of my power.'	3.1508151586720365
'I have not the pleasure of understanding you,  said he, when she had\nfinished her speech.'	3.151032566308326
"Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of\nhis behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as\nguarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his\nrelations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different\nconstruction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor\nWickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire."	3.1517668502945106
"She\nwould not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried\nhome; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think\nit at all advisable."	3.1526670232614307
'When at length they arose to take leave, Mr Bennet was most pressingly\ncivil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and\naddressed herself particularly to Mr Bingley, to assure him how happy\nhe would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,\nwithout the ceremony of a formal invitation.'	3.1536742936318856
'She wished him to\nknow that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the\nplace, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\nvery unexpected-- for your housekeeper,  she added,  informed us that\nyou would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we\nleft Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in\nthe country.'	3.154168659955725
"He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are\nequal."	3.154723018234749
'But I believe your opinion of him would in general\nastonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly\nanywhere else.--Here you are in your own family.'	3.1547703682809005
'You are determined to ruin him in\nthe opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.'	3.154819993380472
'But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\nopportunity.'	3.1549224243458847
"He never\nsaid a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of\nlistening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre\nthat he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in\nbeing at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr\nand Mr Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her\nnot perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever\nshe came into Kent again she would be staying  there  too."	3.15562489321714
'To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and\nwhose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\ninformation, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted\nfor the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an\ninterest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as\nwhat Jane felt for Bingley.'	3.156424467625581
"it is very hard to think\nthat she might have been Mr Collins's wife by this time, had not it\nbeen for her own perverseness."	3.156495546548717
'Then, the two third he danced with Miss\nKing, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane\nagain, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger---- \n\n If he had had any compassion for  me ,  cried her husband impatiently,\n he would not have danced half so much!'	3.1569987241614457
'Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit\ndown for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr Darcy had been\nstanding near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and\nMr Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his\nfriend to join it.'	3.1575804717768805
'They were to be off as soon as possible.'	3.1580855916699417
'Perhaps he had been civil, only because he\nfelt himself at ease; yet there had been  that  in his voice, which was\nnot like ease.'	3.1587758457453154
'After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows,\nto admire the view, Mr Collins attending them to point out its\nbeauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much\nbetter worth looking at in the summer.'	3.159370050058171
'Their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose\nto depart, Mr Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing\ntheir wish of seeing Mr and Mr Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner\nat Pemberley, before they left the country.'	3.1596761063123293
'Risk any thing rather than her\ndispleasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us\nagain, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,\nand be satisfied that  we  shall take no offence.'	3.161347721309621
'She  will not be able to help calling.'	3.1617047973725083
'You will be a very happy woman.'	3.1617607901924005
'You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me\nthe happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the\namusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us\nfor one half hour.'	3.1621713141707084
'I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and\ncould say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing\nforward and precipitate.'	3.163079109698411
'An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr\nGardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing\nremained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of\nthe morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could\nhave supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.'	3.163314188459434
'She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on\nthe subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.'	3.16362386161528
'I know my dear uncle and\n     aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have\n     still something more to ask of the former.'	3.1641801460992727
'When\n     she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;\n     she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said\n     not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so\n     altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly\n     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.'	3.1646946854838953
'She wanted to ascertain the\nfeelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to\nmake herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she\nfeared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she\nendeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.'	3.1654612384464955
'His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living\nbut three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;\nand then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of\nJane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as\nshe could do.'	3.1657613856037297
'Mr Darcy danced\nonly once with Mr Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being\nintroduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in\nwalking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.'	3.166575754584227
"And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of\nthe girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,\n\n The men shan't come and part us, I am determined."	3.1669389545889217
'When Denny,\nand Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they\ndid not know him in the least.'	3.1673850870529807
'I am astonished, my dear,  said Mr Bennet,  that you should be so\nready to think your own children silly.'	3.1680081646115554
'They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their\nastonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mr\nBennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even\ninferior to what Elizabeth felt.'	3.168529732883448
'No,  replied Jane,  I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\nsatisfactory to tell you.'	3.1689132893875325
'But\nat least it shews, that  she  was serious in the object of her journey.'	3.172778550557414
'There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will\ngive him a good name.'	3.172917439079917
"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his\nill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite\na misfortune to be liked by him."	3.1734882142292253
"The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth\nmuch attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing\nbut think, and think with wonder, of Mr Darcy's civility, and above\nall, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister."	3.173744847184168
'Well, mamma,  said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast\nroom,  and what do you think of my husband?'	3.1743416755701475
'But her mind was so busily engaged,\nthat she did not always know when she was silent.'	3.1748089761682015
'I should be sorry, you know,\nto think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.'	3.1761675250013246
"Remember that she is one of a\nlarge family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be\nready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something\nlike regard and esteem for our cousin."	3.176241289264239
'His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade\n     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her\n     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,\n     offering his assistance, as far as it would go.'	3.1766096393800733
"The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter\nof an hour's tête-à-tête with Mr Bennet before breakfast, a\nconversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally\nto the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at\nLongbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general\nencouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.-- As to\nher  younger  daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could\nnot positively answer--but she did not  know  of any prepossession;--her\n eldest  daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her\nto hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."	3.1773117268572415
'Will you be very angry with me, my dear\n     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold\n     enough to say before) how much I like him.'	3.17812309041934
'If you\nwere sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere,\nin which you have been brought up.'	3.1783612929418235
"The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a\nyoung gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been\nbrought up by him at his own expence.-- He is now gone into the army, \nshe added,  but I am afraid he has turned out very wild."	3.1783957616033836
'He said as little as he had ever been in the\nhabit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him\naway, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of\nit.'	3.1793726078825273
'It is not to be supposed\nthat there was much affection in the case.'	3.1794904756343403
'The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,\nwas at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did?'	3.180196772484142
'I see what you are feeling,  replied Charlotte,-- you must be\nsurprised, very much surprised,--so lately as Mr Collins was wishing to\nmarry you.'	3.180362437898581
"Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the\nsociety of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and\nElizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr\nWickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr Darcy's\nlooks and behaviour."	3.1817904586272805
"They had, therefore, many\nacquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since\nthe death of Darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power\nto give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had\nbeen in the way of procuring."	3.182742484011163
'She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see\nwhether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the\nBingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he\nanswered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.'	3.1835649699877315
'She assured him that no one intended to play, and the\nsilence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her.'	3.1838230988331677
'Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every\nfatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.'	3.1841436163322308
'I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put\nit off, and then I should have gone quite distracted.'	3.1848471310192576
"Had she not seen him in\nDerbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no\nother view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial\nto Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming\nthere  with  his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come\nwithout it."	3.1851919259875707
'CHAPTER IX.\n\n\nElizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,\nwhile Mr Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,\nwhen she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a\nvisitor.'	3.1855187358393526
"In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to\nthe compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did\nnot vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to\nreceive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost\nall compassion in anger."	3.187642293586086
'I am not equal to it.'	3.1878051386625907
'But perhaps you have\nbeen too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case\nyou may be sure of my pardon.'	3.1878961090433307
'Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\nvaluable neighbour to Mr Bennet.--They had several children.'	3.188050450456551
'Sir William, how can you tell such a story?--Do not you know\nthat Mr Collins wants to marry Lizzy?'	3.1881285058574833
'But it\nwas her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;\nand all was soon right again.'	3.1882891493440413
'Indeed, Mr Bennet,  said she,  it is very hard to think that Charlotte\nLucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to\nmake way for  her , and live to see her take my place in it!'	3.18996172145723
'But\n     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he\n     wanted.'	3.190165828830488
'He scarcely ever spoke to\nher, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of\nhimself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose\ncivility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and\nespecially to her friend.'	3.1912693733186757
'It had not been very great; he had lost every point;\nbut when Mr Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured\nher with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance,\nthat he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not\nmake herself uneasy.'	3.193717309259717
"Charlotte's first letters\nwere received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be\ncuriosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would\nlike Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to\nbe; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte\nexpressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen."	3.193750796582009
'With what delighted pride she\nafterwards visited Mr Bingley and talked of Mr Darcy may be guessed.'	3.196478962422496
"Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and\nthey continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put\nan end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr\nWickham's attentions."	3.196653178947307
'But I was not then\n     master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.'	3.197741601393628
'His marriage was\nnow fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think\nit inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that\nshe   wished  they might be happy.'	3.1977686164743635
'That is very true,  replied Elizabeth,  and I could easily forgive\n his  pride, if he had not mortified  mine .'	3.1984871695880197
'No, Lizzy, that is what I do  not  choose.'	3.1986318480943328
'She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of\nWickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.'	3.19929275943759
'I dare say Mr Bingley will be very\nglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\nhearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though\nI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.'	3.2000998625272743
'This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and\nshe could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the\nacquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had\nrevolted, in his offer to herself.'	3.200764104755685
'The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her\nfather, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.'	3.2011083315567284
'If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form\nof encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as\nmay convince you of its being one.'	3.201229525232447
"Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she\nknew not how to believe that Mr Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr\nBingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the\nveracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.--The\npossibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to\ninterest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be\ndone, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and\nthrow into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be\notherwise explained."	3.201265391946133
'With assumed tranquillity he then replied,  I have no wish of denying\nthat I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your\nsister, or that I rejoice in my success.'	3.2016216989001895
"Whilst wandering on in this\nslow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was\nquite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr Darcy\napproaching them, and at no great distance."	3.20209632622162
'you do not know what I suffer.'	3.2024365546707885
"The possibility of Mr Collins's fancying himself in love with her\nfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but\nthat Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from\npossibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her\nastonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the\nbounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,\n\n Engaged to Mr Collins!"	3.2025269918637562
'In anticipating the happiness of Bingley,\nwhich of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the\nconversation till they reached the house.'	3.2031473442911897
"Mr Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from\ntheir recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly\nexpressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own\ncarriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if\nshe had not happened to see Mr Jones's shop boy in the street, who had\ntold her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield\nbecause the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed\ntowards Mr Collins by Jane's introduction of him."	3.203226831625147
'Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I\nwas of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\nless certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\nany thing to deserve to lose it.'	3.2042252987362416
'It\nwas an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease\nand liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved,\nand from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must\nhave received benefit of greater importance.'	3.205196547315385
'Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\naccomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\nfortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they\nhad yet learnt to care for at a ball.'	3.2066680531695857
"Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;\nand in the evening Mr Bennet's invention was again at work to get\nevery body away from him and her daughter."	3.207561451591251
"It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he\nhad pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended\nhim still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in\nbeing with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her\nformer favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw\nthere was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,\nshe believed he might have the best informed mind."	3.208009031985301
'Her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think\nhim less agreeable.'	3.2086957058894208
'If he had been so very\nagreeable he would have talked to Mr Long.'	3.2090126975438364
'Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr Bingley.--But--good\nlord!'	3.2100508710754707
'Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though\nthe carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking\nwas her only alternative.'	3.21097396316076
'I know not, Miss Elizabeth,  said he,  whether Mr Collins has yet\nexpressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very\ncertain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for\nit.'	3.2109970575432096
"And in the wretched state of his own\nfinances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to\nhis fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired\nthat he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable\namount."	3.2120104654106374
'She longed to see Mr Philips, the Lucases, and all\ntheir other neighbours, and to hear herself called  Mr Wickham,  by\neach of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her\nring and boast of being married, to Mr Hill and the two housemaids.'	3.212650986028696
'Could she exert herself it would be better, but\n     this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life\n     saw him so affected.'	3.21313685090463
"I felt a\nlittle uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in\nmarriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite\nright."	3.2131531578488888
"To be sure, Lizzy,  said her aunt,  he is not so handsome as Wickham;\nor rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are\nperfectly good."	3.213855772671506
"And with regard to the\nresentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former\n were  excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's\nconcern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in\nthe scorn."	3.2141764971942974
'But it ought to\nbe done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done\ndirectly.'	3.214603255464625
"CHAPTER IX.\n\n\nElizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the\nmorning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the\nenquiries which she very early received from Mr Bingley by a housemaid,\nand some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his\nsisters."	3.214826138583095
"Widely\ndifferent was the effect of a second perusal.--How could she deny that\ncredit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to\ngive in the other?--He declared himself to have been totally\nunsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help\nremembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been.--Neither could she\ndeny the justice of his description of Jane.--She felt that Jane's\nfeelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a\nconstant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great\nsensibility."	3.21590922093537
'Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mr\nBennet instantly answered,\n\n Oh dear!--Yes--certainly.--I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am\nsure she can have no objection.--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs.'	3.2164884139432486
'They are not married,\n     nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are\n     willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on\n     your side, I hope it will not be long before they are.'	3.217061791625881
'Aye, there she comes,  continued Mr Bennet,  looking as unconcerned\nas may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided\nshe can have her own way.--But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take\nit into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,\nyou will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is\nto maintain you when your father is dead.-- I  shall not be able to keep\nyou--and so I warn you.--I have done with you from this very day.--I\ntold you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you\nagain, and you will find me as good as my word.'	3.2173740095736973
'In\nconfirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\ntransactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming\nher authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.'	3.217683063473144
'Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her\nfeelings appear what they were not.'	3.2186224941161976
"She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony\nwas not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it\npossible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every\nbetter feeling to worldly advantage."	3.218839003905173
'You know it is not\nsound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.'	3.221188965071192
'I was so vexed to see him stand\nup with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all:'	3.2212391986247133
"CHAPTER XVII.\n\n\nElizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no\nlonger be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular\nin which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,\nshe related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr\nDarcy and herself."	3.2214407112370105
'thought she.'	3.2214449937458216
'Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;\nbut Mr Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the\naffair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.'	3.221956467285071
'It was reasonable that he should feel\nhe had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising\nit; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,\nshe could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might\nassist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be\nmaterially concerned.'	3.2223499725896705
"It was some days, however, before they\nreceived any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the\nhouse, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,\nalmost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by\nsuch an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\ncome there in the evening."	3.2232759620591884
'And if you will stay\nanother  month  complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as\nfar as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as\nDawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room\nfor one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I\nshould not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.'	3.2244059436971524
'Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;\nand every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the\nappearance of his goodness.'	3.225712592215934
'I  did  hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so\npalatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually\ndeclared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business\nhad been compromised accordingly.'	3.2258445872194224
"He  was\n     exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I\n     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with  her  behaviour\n     while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter\n     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a\n     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no\n     fresh pain."	3.2264979022825258
'said Mr Bennet, more than\nonce, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.'	3.2270364776706595
'There, shut into her own room,\nas soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption\nof all that she had heard.'	3.227648446907831
"But in an instant arose the\ndreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr Darcy's\npleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this\nwas not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was\npronounced by his friend Mr Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and\nwho told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business\nthe day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant\nsmile,\n\n I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if\nhe had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here."	3.2283589390281016
'The church  ought  to have been my profession--I\nwas brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in\npossession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we\nwere speaking of just now.'	3.2283883719197206
'I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr Darcy has no defect.'	3.2288400386273675
'I thank you for my share of the favour,  said Elizabeth;  but I do not\nparticularly like your way of getting husbands.'	3.2295402067199985
'She could\nthink of nothing but of Mr Wickham, and of what he had told her, all\nthe way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as\nthey went, for neither Lydia nor Mr Collins were once silent.'	3.2309332137724076
'If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as\nyou.'	3.231857483678602
'With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added,  How long did you\nsay that he was at Rosings?'	3.232225158017541
'I\n     take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,\n     but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging\n     you all to come here, as soon as possible.'	3.232298540283039
'no.--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\nfeelings.'	3.2323174111154236
'Perhaps I\ndid not always love him so well as I do now.'	3.2339976076985
'I believe her to be both in a great degree,  replied Wickham;  I have\nnot seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked\nher, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.'	3.2343967017447985
'She felt it to be the\nprobable consequence of her allusions to Mr Wickham, and rejoiced in\nit.'	3.2345231893046646
'I will go directly to Mr Bennet, and\nwe shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.'	3.234569181905763
'was a question\nwhich Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and\nfrom all the others when they sat down to table.'	3.235103528552031
'You are a good girl;  he replied,  and I have great pleasure in\nthinking you will be so happily settled.'	3.23571600262457
"He answered\nme with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,\nthat he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be\ncertain she could never bestow a favour unworthily."	3.2362907438266304
'You do not\nknow what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in\nsuch terms.'	3.2384173215312657
'When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her\nhand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a\nsimpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant\nin the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence.'	3.239667284672766
'Till I was in Kent, and saw\nso much both of Mr Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was\nignorant of the truth myself.'	3.240890666477425
"They had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was\nalso coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her\nsatisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step\nwas heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room."	3.241526640945219
'Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,  said Mr\nBennet;  and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle\ndirectly.'	3.2430520184119165
'I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly\nbeyond my own party.'	3.243524071076676
'His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the\nmilitia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship\nwith any of them.'	3.2453043578353697
"It was the favourite wish of\n his  mother, as well as of her's."	3.2457925779624714
'His fear of her, has always operated, I\nknow, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his\nwish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he\nhas very much at heart.'	3.245812800198017
'Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep\nhis house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming\nneighbour in her.'	3.246164633191201
'Though I\n know  it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him\nso much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on\nsetting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to\nyou.'	3.2468270087598405
"But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be\nsuspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mr\nGardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him."	3.2472867330782687
'He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence;\nbut it had not been so in Derbyshire.'	3.2474896511861346
"It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that\nsuch a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very\nday of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late\nbreakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by\nsome exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it\nwould be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following\nmorning."	3.2475125936487097
'I do not know a place in the country that is\nequal to Netherfield.'	3.247543072022748
'If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the\nyounger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time,\nfor from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was\nsuch a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.'	3.248228165924656
'You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me\nto play and sing before any body and every body!--If my vanity had taken\na musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would\nreally rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of\nhearing the very best performers.'	3.2483001704688235
'Those to her mother, contained little else, than that\nthey were just returned from the library, where such and such officers\nhad attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as\nmade her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which\nshe would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a\nviolent hurry, as Mr Forster called her, and they were going to the\ncamp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less\nto be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much\ntoo full of lines under the words to be made public.'	3.248355574232864
'It was\ngenerally evident whenever they met, that he  did  admire her; and to\n her  it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference\nwhich she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\nway to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it\nwas not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane\nunited with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a\nuniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the\nsuspicions of the impertinent.'	3.249911689700012
'And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\ncredit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more\nthan I ever look into.'	3.250197767498988
"He had found the law a most unprofitable study,\n     and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would\n     present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there\n     could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other\n     person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered\n     father's intentions."	3.2502926695760106
'It was possible, however,\nthat some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more\ninformation; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the\napplication was a something to look forward to.'	3.2504791530083366
'When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be\ndone but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any\nintermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every\nsubject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have\nher judgment controverted.'	3.251695152211336
"Mr Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton\nassemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty\nwomen in the room, and  which  he thought the prettiest?"	3.252176087838103
"Elizabeth listened as little as she\ncould, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name."	3.252943251170391
'There is a lady, it seems, a\n     Mr Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was\n     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though\n     he did not say what.'	3.2537619091774563
'Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a\n scheme  of infamy.'	3.2543483074723722
'She could not yet recover from the\nsurprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing\nelse, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after\nbreakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise.'	3.2561101215500314
'But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect\nof her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her\nspirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had\nnot seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to\nthe oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular\nnotice.'	3.2573452271067054
"She endeavoured to\npersuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be\nblind to Miss Bingley's inattention."	3.2575449831911083
'On the following Monday, Mr Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her\nbrother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at\nLongbourn.'	3.257988063776119
'Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could\nregard with any complacency.'	3.2589119586146853
'All that I can promise you, therefore, is not\nto be in a hurry.'	3.259117126822124
'My excellent father\n     died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr Wickham was to\n     the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it\n     to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his\n     profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a\n     valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became\n     vacant.'	3.2610880137222797
'But Mr Gardiner\n     could not be seen, and Mr Darcy found, on further enquiry, that\n     your father was still with him, but would quit town the next\n     morning.'	3.2626612541403994
'You could not have met with a person more capable of\ngiving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been\nconnected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy.'	3.262705171408896
'She found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short\npause, added,\n\n I think I have understood that Mr Bingley has not much idea of ever\nreturning to Netherfield again?'	3.263499810804871
'Why, my dear, you must know, Mr Long says that Netherfield is taken\nby a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came\ndown on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much\ndelighted with it that he agreed with Mr Morris immediately; that he is\nto take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be\nin the house by the end of next week.'	3.264064517709098
'After an affectionate\nparting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by\nMr Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning\nher with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks\nfor the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his\ncompliments to Mr and Mr Gardiner, though unknown.'	3.2642102213725774
'but he was in such a hurry to be gone,\nand his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding\nout even so much as this.'	3.2644322242817463
'After\nlamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking\nthat Mr Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn,\nand the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though\nhe had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have\ntwo full courses.'	3.2650465324039923
'Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect\nindifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and\nher hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the\nnext morning to London.'	3.267041102769075
'as soon\n     as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn.'	3.2671331589851182
"When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my\nbrother Gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my\nsister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away."	3.2695788813651947
'Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their\nsafe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it\nwould be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.'	3.2701684301115694
'To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to\nexpose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would\nhave been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or\nfiner success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister\nthat some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his\nfeelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he\nmust have witnessed.'	3.2706023557271067
'In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make\nher resigned.'	3.2729464939645605
'You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and\nof course she will be always at Pemberley with you.'	3.2746798587575805
"When she thought\nof her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would\nnot allow that any objections  there  had material weight with Mr\nDarcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from\nthe want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want\nof sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly\ngoverned by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of\nretaining Mr Bingley for his sister."	3.275848590684328
'I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such\na way.'	3.275876254617248
'And there are other\ncircumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to\nrelate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.'	3.2763933948855013
'When all this was resolved\n     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at\n     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more\n     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to\n     receive the last finish.'	3.2766592780498716
'He meant to provide for me amply,\nand thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\nelsewhere.'	3.277060050058129
"To the civil enquiries which then\npoured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the\nmuch superior solicitude of Mr Bingley's, she could not make a very\nfavourable answer."	3.2783995265221324
'They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not\nlike at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency\nwithout fashion, which is intolerable.'	3.2784649111756483
'But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that\nBingley was the person meant.'	3.2791604505390923
'His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of\nthe highest kind.'	3.279492966053248
'When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley\ncould not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to\nhis sister.'	3.279611649845925
'Now I am quite happy,  said she,  for you will be as happy as myself.'	3.279850172834351
"Mr Bingley does not know the whole of his\nhistory, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\nprincipally offended Mr Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,\nthe probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that\nMr Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr Darcy than he has\nreceived; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his\nsister's, Mr Wickham is by no means a respectable young man."	3.2801313075573613
'We may as well leave them by themselves you know;  said her mother as\nsoon as she was in the hall.'	3.2811923789926025
'She was very\nequal therefore to address Mr Bingley on the subject of the ball, and\nabruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most\nshameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.'	3.2823177800199663
'My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others\nwere to meet us at the church.'	3.283764647495841
'How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that\nI should be so reasonable as to admit it!'	3.2847694572032737
'Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,\nbecause it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a\ngirl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is\nmercenary.'	3.2872395218446617
'I do not trust my own\npartiality.'	3.2873912072824307
'They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr Gardiner, after\ngeneral assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told\nher that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist\nMr Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.'	3.2886628363442254
"Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mr Collins you\nhave been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear\nthat your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be\nas well to be silent."	3.2891031893500347
'Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference\nof his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving\nheart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice\nher against him.'	3.289547876755908
'I do not blame Jane,  she continued,  for Jane would have got Mr\nBingley, if she could.'	3.2907485704603854
'I knew it myself, as\n     it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant\n     of it.--That they might have met without ill consequence, is\n     perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough\n     extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--Perhaps this\n     concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--It is done, however,\n     and it was done for the best.--On this subject I have nothing more\n     to say, no other apology to offer.'	3.292088291139298
"I have told Miss Bennet several times, that\nshe will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though\nMr Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often\ntold her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in\nMr Jenkinson's room."	3.2928053328721205
"It is not that I do not believe  my  fingers as\ncapable as any other woman's of superior execution."	3.29508433971701
'Mr Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon\ndone--done while Mr Bennet was stirring the fire.'	3.295256613707332
'We will be down as soon as we can,  said Jane;  but I dare say Kitty is\nforwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.'	3.297311617307244
'She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss\nBingley was uncivil to  her , and more teazing than usual to himself.'	3.2976097554636135
'A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her\nalarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\ncuriosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the\nnext morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and\nwith a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike\nto the scheme.'	3.2980304507006686
'I do not know.--I hope there was.--But to be guarded at such a time, is\nvery difficult.'	3.2997803177703955
'If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should\n     be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of\n     duplicity in all this.'	3.3004501364183296

'You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not\nconceal your age.'	3.3034643464818085
'She is\na very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but\nI will  make  her know it.'	3.3054558223977493
"Such were the gentle murmurs of Mr Bennet, and they\ngave way only to the greater distress of Mr Bingley's continued\nabsence."	3.30545988179078
'I am sure,  she added,  if it was not for such good friends I do not\nknow what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a\nvast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is\nalways the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest\ntemper I ever met with.'	3.3060647468383246
'At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,\n\n And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!'	3.306242297336369
'Poor Charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to\nsuch society!--But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though\nevidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to\nask for compassion.'	3.3070317520116794
'how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would\nchaperon you about to all the balls.'	3.3071833159029356
'If it was not allowable for him to gain  my \naffections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for\nmaking love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally\npoor?'	3.3078027334731925
'To the rest of the family they paid little attention;\navoiding Mr Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,\nand nothing at all to the others.'	3.3081289631499753
'That Mr Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but\nwithout gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now\ndetermined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr Bennet\nthought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first\ncoming to London, before they procured lodgings.'	3.309468564282466
'Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,\nand that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without\ncalling her attention.'	3.309948055415554
'She had a sister married to a Mr Philips, who had been a clerk to their\nfather, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in\nLondon in a respectable line of trade.'	3.310565892001442
'I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you\nwill favour me with your company.'	3.3110393678860777
'Mr Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling\nsolemnity replied,\n\n It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your\ntime not disagreeably.'	3.312018062708274
'What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?'	3.3120444885168236
'She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of\nadmiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because\nhe disliked her, was still more strange.'	3.3127257261423413
"Find such a woman as soon as\nyou can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the\nway, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and\nkindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\nadvantages in my power to offer."	3.3140174018546396
'Your\n     father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they\n     had a great deal of talk together.'	3.3151901186042965
'That he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest\nopinion.'	3.315451101754861
'Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a\nvery different man from what he is to the less prosperous.'	3.315915106459372
'The compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt.'	3.318041933764895
'Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will\nmake an offer to me.'	3.318261203470088
'As Mr Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she\nand her children should go to London, at the same time that Mr Bennet\ncame from it.'	3.3231114230291263
'And with no one to speak to, of what I\nfelt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and\nvain and nonsensical as I knew I had!'	3.3238137219982895
"Mr Denny and Mr Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of\nMr Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's\npressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mr\nPhilips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the\ninvitation."	3.325156827751484
'No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have\nbeen to blame.'	3.32550614386818
"Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister\nexcept Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr Collins was to attend them,\nat the request of Mr Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,\nand have his library to himself; for thither Mr Collins had followed\nhim after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with\none of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr\nBennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford."	3.326481592920505
'He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;\nthat his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to\nher, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her\nthe whole evening.'	3.3266131776684
"My dear Jane, I am in\nsuch a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you\nwrite for me."	3.326958682883031
'To know\nthat she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish\nJane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own\nvanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation\nto openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision\nin which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate;\nand her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into\nrepeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister\nfarther.'	3.327313243205711
'The reason why all this was to be done by him\n     alone, was such as I have given above.'	3.329285375406475
'Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr Darcy, was in such misery\nof shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.'	3.3300233065376164
"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,  said\nElizabeth angrily;  for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse\nthan of being the son of Mr Darcy's steward, and of  that , I can\nassure you, he informed me himself."	3.330784241497743
'She could not help frequently\nglancing her eye at Mr Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what\nshe dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was\nconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.'	3.33080676227337
'I do not mind his not talking to Mr Long,  said Miss Lucas,  but I\nwish he had danced with Eliza.'	3.331280078502285
"They were not the only objects of Mr Collins's admiration."	3.332709676343509
'Without supposing\nthem, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference\nof each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she\nresolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left\nHertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such\nan attachment.'	3.336345362473691
'When Mr Bennet was told of this, she did\nnot express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering\nwhat her anxiety for his life had been before.'	3.3372691299149895
'Your examination of Mr Darcy is over, I presume,  said Miss\nBingley;-- and pray what is the result?'	3.340104072623405
'Mr Darcy looked just as he had been\nused to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual\nreserve, to Mr Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her\nfriend, met her with every appearance of composure.'	3.3428265353005266
'I could not\nallow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months\nlast winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.'	3.344012619684576
'When I am in the country,  he replied,  I never wish to leave it; and\nwhen I am in town it is pretty much the same.'	3.3443288932330377
'If she heard me,\n     it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen.'	3.3473159542328186
'But it is fortunate,  thought she,  that I have something to wish for.'	3.347585228599387
'The carriage was sent to meet\nthem at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time.'	3.3477203919947733
'CHAPTER II.\n\n\nElizabeth had settled it that Mr Darcy would bring his sister to visit\nher, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently\nresolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.'	3.3484981995357255
'CHAPTER XI.\n\n\nWhen the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister,\nand seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the\ndrawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many\nprofessions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable\nas they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.'	3.3490077729784566
'I do not know whether I ever before\nmentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the\ncountry without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\nunreasonable.'	3.349233802472696
'She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till\nlate in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and\nwhen it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go\ndown stairs herself.'	3.349768081213095
'Mr Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have\ntwo daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of\nthe day before, was now high in her good graces.'	3.351253907233206
'Secondly, that I am convinced it will add\nvery greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have\nmentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation\nof the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.'	3.3514614687810016
'There is no talk of his\ncoming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every\nbody too, who is likely to know.'	3.3518522844258967
'Mr Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired\nher and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom\nthey should not object to know more of.'	3.351867129674822
'If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.'	3.3543140693689972
"Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr Darcy\nwas expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were\nnot many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would\nfurnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and\nshe might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him\nwere, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined\nby Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest\nsatisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and\nseemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by\nMiss Lucas and herself."	3.3567788562875975
'It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I\n     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.'	3.358779130772581
'She was convinced that\nshe could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they\nshould meet.'	3.359246074706566
'He did not talk to me of his own arts,  said Fitzwilliam smiling.'	3.359402722343407
'No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.'	3.3594529947153173
'I did not think Mr\nGardiner was so little to be trusted.'	3.359627283505494
"Mr Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned\ninstantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the\nremarks of the two ladies and Mr Darcy; the latter of whom, however,\ncould not be prevailed on to join in their censure of  her , in spite of\nall Miss Bingley's witticisms on  fine eyes ."	3.360417837897204
'My dear Madam,  he replied,  this invitation is particularly\ngratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you\nmay be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as\npossible.'	3.364813834458413
'We are not in a way to know  what  Mr Bingley likes,  said her mother\nresentfully,  since we are not to visit.'	3.3650565471688423
'He must go\n     somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have\n     nothing to live on.'	3.367432241226595
'As soon as ever Mr Bingley comes, my dear,  said Mr Bennet,  you\nwill wait on him of course.'	3.368408454381705
'Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help\nfancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect\nand its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if\nwishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.'	3.374788884209664
'It is a great comfort to have you\n     so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will\n     think of us.'	3.3751348578954703
'On the contrary every particular relative\nto his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and\nif I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who\nwill believe me?'	3.3759937550342665
'As to\nhis real character, had information been in her power, she had never\nfelt a wish of enquiring.'	3.3770780024469906
'It\nwould be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can\nhardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.'	3.3788787713740347
'My dear Mr Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of\ntheir father and mother.--When they get to our age I dare say they will\nnot think about officers any more than we do.'	3.3802408475456778
"Colonel\nFitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was\ngenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told\nher; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of\nlove, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself\nseriously to work to find it out.--She watched him whenever they were at\nRosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success."	3.383932168882093
'She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear\nof seeing Mr Darcy--that Mr Darcy might leave the country, but that\n he  should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball\nthe very next week.'	3.3851053173897885
'I do not deserve it.'	3.387282601293056
'But, though\nthis might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour\nto Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane.'	3.389866499541063
'I found,  said he,  as the time drew near, that I had better not meet\nMr Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so\nmany hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes\nmight arise unpleasant to more than myself.'	3.3906590813757225
'To Mr Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at\nNetherfield long enough.'	3.391813735435325
'True,  said Mr Bennet,  but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of\nthat kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always\nmake the most of it.'	3.3937758360070647
'I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have\nsupposed about Mr Bingley.'	3.3943253780044884
'CHAPTER XIII.\n\n\n I hope, my dear,  said Mr Bennet to his wife, as they were at\nbreakfast the next morning,  that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,\nbecause I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.'	3.395633082057853
'He observed to her, at a\nmoment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had\nsomething of real regret, that it  was a very long time since he had had\nthe pleasure of seeing her;  and, before she could reply, he added,  It\nis above eight months.'	3.3989488541047654
'It has been a very agreeable day,  said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth.'	3.400508624844461
'As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she\nunderstood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and\nNetherfield, and she blushed as she answered,\n\n I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her\nfamily.'	3.40315070151069
'As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be\nLady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her\nhalf-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,\nwhen the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr Darcy, and Mr\nDarcy only, entered the room.'	3.40361579756773
'Aye, so it is,  cried her mother,  and Mr Long does not come back\ntill the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him,\nfor she will not know him herself.'	3.403971831170129
'Well, he is a\nvery undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least\nchance in the world of her ever getting him now.'	3.404560336903752
"It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be\ngenerally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family,\nit would be an unpleasant thing."	3.404919783929057
'The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so\nsoon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be\nsafe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where\nshe felt herself to be right.'	3.4051688340730584
'Is it true?'	3.410363030202349
'She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion\nof her.'	3.414883866543875
"I do not see what right Mr Darcy had to decide on the propriety of\nhis friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to\ndetermine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy."	3.4155713000052934
'I knew that Mr Wickham ought not to be a\n     clergyman.'	3.415710535798161
'Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked\nhim better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never\nseen him so pleasant as this morning.'	3.4162007552093443
'Whenever Charlotte came to see\nthem she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and\nwhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr Collins, was convinced that\nthey were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself\nand her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr Bennet were dead.'	3.416327101078983
'How Mr Darcy looked, therefore, she could\nnot tell.'	3.4201187967378
'And  that  is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his\nfriend, and Mr Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a\npart of London!'	3.4202625500111092
