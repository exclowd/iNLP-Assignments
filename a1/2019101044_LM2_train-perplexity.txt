"He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the\nhundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket\nallowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her,\nthrough her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very little within\nthat sum."	1.6029083716243573

'I am always glad to get a young person well placed out.'	1.6120008601041689
"When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she found little\nother cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment."	1.6120897982272895
'He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the\ntrouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which\nsupplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and\ndespise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,\npersuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to\navoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.'	1.6121769649902877

'But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr Wickham, when\nshe read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which,\nif true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which\nbore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings\nwere yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.'	1.6145076106598493
'He was received by Mr\nBennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed,\nespecially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of\nher curtsey and address to his friend.'	1.6145163002890501

"Mr Collins readily assented,\nand a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced\nit to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging\npardon, protested that he never read novels.--Kitty stared at him, and\nLydia exclaimed.--Other books were produced, and after some deliberation\nhe chose Fordyce's Sermons."	1.6156590964775133

'And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?'	1.6157689981414092
'In his present\nbehaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,\nfor the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which\nhad marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after\nwhat had since passed, to provoke her.'	1.6159807650775475
"You\n     will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr Wickham's\n     circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to\n     be."	1.6160627987998737

'But if\notherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or\nunnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a\nfirst interview with its object, and even before two words have been\nexchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given\nsomewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,\nand that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other\nless interesting mode of attachment.'	1.6232743692763092

'It had always been evident to her that such an\nincome as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in\ntheir wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to\ntheir support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or\nherself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance\ntowards discharging their bills.'	1.6237871091330656
'Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.'	1.6240437568852306
"She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new\nclothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of\nshame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they\ntook place."	1.6241562520047514

'The perpetual\ncommendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness\nof his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern\nwith which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was\nexactly in unison with her opinion of each.'	1.6320966378455954

"Be that as it may, she saw him go\nwith regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must\nproduce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched\nbusiness."	1.6372694912616477
'He who, she had been\npersuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this\naccidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without\nany indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where\ntheir two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion\nof her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.'	1.6374807487869087

'Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall\nall have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding.'	1.641093277767208
'May I ask\nwhether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the\nmoment, or are the result of previous study?'	1.64120464286619
'It seemed like wilful\nill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not\nmerely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he\nactually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.'	1.6412722158086135
'Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep\nin mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to\nhide it, not doing its office.'	1.6416434142399883
'Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for\nhimself.'	1.6419488250073369
'It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted\nso in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves\nbefore anybody else.'	1.6421447927862063
'Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her\npoultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their\ncharms.'	1.6422824045385747
"Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture\nthey had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two\nthat they now saw Mr Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on\nbeholding his master, must immediately have told it."	1.642407925363593
'And this,  cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,\n is your opinion of me!'	1.6427203411519569
'At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels\nplaced within, and it was pronounced to be ready.'	1.6427625394936545
'But, luckily, he came back\nagain in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.'	1.6427716145829578
'You will hardly bear to be\nlong outdone by Jane.'	1.6430114966979388
"From these instructions they were summoned by the\narrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr\nCollins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed."	1.643025809229848
'As they passed through the hall,\nLady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and\ndrawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent\nlooking rooms, walked on.'	1.6430459474544465
'His air was grave and\nstately, and his manners were very formal.'	1.6430518372507825
'After waiting at home every morning\nfor a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the\nvisitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,\nthe alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no\nlonger.'	1.6430625877139888
'Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with\nindignation.'	1.6430910060272303
'He\nthen said,\n\n I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me\nexceedingly.'	1.6431393776681043
'No--why should he?'	1.643305328789192
'His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but\n     a little more liveliness, and  that , if he marry  prudently , his\n     wife may teach him.'	1.643559566343764
'Presuming, however,\nthat this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than\nany dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of\nsociety, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for\nher attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.'	1.6438750828914364
'Girls, can I do any\nthing for you in Meryton?'	1.64394884078105
'No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and\nyou will feel the effects of it.'	1.6440541574107106
'there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.'	1.64431030529501
'The sight of\nMiss Lucas was odious to her.'	1.6445903093831777
'He should be particularly happy at any time, &c.'	1.6451384664522886
'When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth\nbegan to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and\nsolicitude they shewed for Jane.'	1.6453450589810887
'I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain\nfrom declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young\ncouple into your house as soon as they were married.'	1.6454364538286075
'She could not determine how her mother\nwould take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur\nwould be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.'	1.6454496069247009
"The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the\nLucas's last week; and even Mr Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges\nwere remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French\ncooks at least."	1.6455625653718529
'They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon\nMaria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,\nwhen Kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone.'	1.6457419672347704
'But it has been the study of\nmy life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong\nunderstanding to ridicule.'	1.6458497975761908
'Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the\npreservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was\nhurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill\napplied.'	1.6459181502784515
'For\nthough elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the\ncontrary, he was all attention to every body.'	1.6459307266595866
'With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new\nacquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.'	1.6461129058658903
'A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his\nfeatures, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\nfor her own weakness, could not go on.'	1.6462424025494131
'she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!'	1.6462581289338658
'They have none of them much to recommend them,  replied he;  they are\nall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\nquickness than her sisters.'	1.646420614761006
'Charles, when you build  your  house, I wish it may be\nhalf as delightful as Pemberley.'	1.646619609804401
'At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of\nElizabeth after the health of her family.'	1.6468074440998044

'Mr Darcy was\n     punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the\n     wedding.'	1.6470889487527722
'Mr Collins, you must send a servant with them.'	1.6470896946948002
'And since this sad\naffair has taken place, it is said, that he left Meryton greatly in\ndebt; but I hope this may be false.'	1.6473121132331112
"They were of a respectable family in\nthe north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their\nmemories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been\nacquired by trade."	1.6481684773172052
'That is very strange.'	1.6481812236438294
'They are all for what they can get.'	1.648212941177962
'You may remember\nwhat I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.'	1.6483138124097165
'Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all\nthis?'	1.6484493770634514
'His pride, in that direction,\nmay be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter\nhim from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by.'	1.6485620797713634
'And there are several of the young men, too, that she\nlikes very much.'	1.648723583895959
'--\n\n My dear Madam,  replied he,  let us be for ever silent on this point.'	1.6491850280865854
'You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here\nwith the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be\ndissuaded from it.'	1.6493722428496933
'We must have Mr Long and the Gouldings soon.'	1.6494517666930748
'By all means,  cried Bingley;  let us hear all the particulars, not\nforgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more\nweight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of.'	1.6495882100582195
'His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.'	1.649786110747988
'The same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the\nevening.'	1.6499634803062944
"Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters\nwas exactly what Darcy had hoped to see."	1.6500792194623968
'I am only resolved to act in that manner,\nwhich will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without\nreference to  you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.'	1.6501138358838605
'Mr Bennet chose to consider it as given in\ncompliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by\nreceiving the invitation from Mr Bingley himself, instead of a\nceremonious card.'	1.650634817551125
'How could I\n     be so silly as to wish it!'	1.650635850347309
'But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.'	1.6506700295712555
'We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest\npart of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,\nsharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.'	1.6506898374885084
'We do not suffer by  accident .'	1.650771594647032
'Elizabeth preserved as steady a\nsilence as either Mr Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too\nmuch fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of  Lord,\nhow tired I am!'	1.65086511551242
'yes.--Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be\nplaced in the gallery at Pemberley.'	1.6509697304958375
'His brother-in-law, Mr Hurst, merely\nlooked the gentleman; but his friend Mr Darcy soon drew the attention\nof the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and\nthe report which was in general circulation within five minutes after\nhis entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.'	1.6510537173965232
'I only fear that\nthe sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding,\nis merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and\njudgment he stands much in awe.'	1.6510790175101382
"Your's, very\n     sincerely,\n\n      M. GARDINER. \n\nThe contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,\nin which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the\ngreatest share."	1.6511082263723336
'She has the\nreputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe\nshe derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from\nher authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who\nchuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of\nthe first class.'	1.6514742557833175
"At first there\nseemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most\ndetermined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,\nshe soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets\nand exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in\nparticular."	1.6515377642467501
'Your attendance upon her, has been too much for you.'	1.6517577706656943
'I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any\none.'	1.651785092014584
'Mr Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.'	1.6520896393506717
'Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my\npositive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I\nhave often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the\nblessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.'	1.6521495486320543
'Elizabeth read on;  I have seen them both.'	1.6522623826261726
'If therefore she\nactually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to\nforce her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of\ntemper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.'	1.652407129634608
'Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your\nadvice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though\nin the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and\nhabitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like\nyourself.'	1.6526073236926464
'He called it, therefore, his duty to step\n     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on\n     by himself.'	1.6527378462477158
'She\nwrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing\nwhich she could not praise.'	1.6528783017579398
'This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and\nthe little value he put on his own good qualities.'	1.6533498241776938
'She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,\nand had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of\nquadrille in the evening.'	1.6533896295669348
'She will\nmake him a very proper wife.'	1.6539896202232554
'Generous, good man, I am afraid he has\ndistressed himself.'	1.6540292454682857
'By Mr Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and\non their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,\nsucceeded for a few moments.'	1.654162020961498
'We were always encouraged to\nread, and had all the masters that were necessary.'	1.6546657620864311
'But what,  said she, after a pause,  can have been his motive?--what\ncan have induced him to behave so cruelly?'	1.6548899489376678
'I cannot make him\nout.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he\nmean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he\nwould help it, if he could.--Can he be a sensible man, sir?'	1.6552150913686126
'It is amazing to me,  said Bingley,  how young ladies can have patience\nto be so very accomplished, as they all are.'	1.6554164317759712
'Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving\nhim the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and\nhypocrisy of my son-in-law.'	1.6557936594169615
'They stood a little\naloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\nscarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she\nreturned to his civil enquiries after her family.'	1.656200049157933
'Who do you mean, my dear?'	1.6562144272573052
"Lady\nCatherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his\ncomfort, appeared very remarkable."	1.6562176888688933
'He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from\nsurprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,\nand spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least\nof perfect civility.'	1.656751743913176
'It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,  he added,\n which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.'	1.656845088623142
'Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day\n     before, not many hours after the express.'	1.6570166102444575
'Their eyes\nwere immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers,\nand nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin\nin a shop window, could recal them.'	1.6570804879107424
"She was not of so ungovernable a\ntemper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she\nbecame, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less\nignorant, and less insipid."	1.657120477893301
'Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her\napplication, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited\nmanner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she\nhad reached.'	1.6571969144114924
'Every girl in, or near Meryton, was out of her senses about him\nfor the first two months; but he never distinguished  her  by any\nparticular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of\nextravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others\nof the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her\nfavourites.'	1.6572372532876678
'The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a\nheadache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to\nher unwillingness to see Mr Darcy, it determined her not to attend her\ncousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.'	1.6575038022825936
'She is happy, then,  said her father, drily;  and her residence there\nwill probably be of some duration.'	1.6575208629745983
'She had obtained private intelligence that Mr\nDarcy did not wish for cards; and Mr Hurst soon found even his open\npetition rejected.'	1.6583677605575176
"His manners are very different from his cousin's."	1.6584784998309507
'He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as\nElizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.'	1.658890948952145
'But I know the\nfoundation is unjust.'	1.6590231705898504
'He sat down for a few moments, and\nthen getting up walked about the room.'	1.6590539303748668
'She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.'	1.6590877029410787
'You may imagine what I felt\n     and how I acted.'	1.6591964648106354
'You shall not, for the sake of one\nindividual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor\nendeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and\ninsensibility of danger, security for happiness.'	1.6594937637533305
'Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and\nthanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.'	1.6600289476195547
'If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act\n     in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will\n     immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper\n     settlement.'	1.6602979373359226
'Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what\nshe had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years\nago.'	1.6606741903724613
'But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was\nshortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by\nan article of news, which then began to be in circulation.'	1.6608804960938195
'The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two\nyounger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin\nJane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and\nsweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every\nway--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.'	1.6609871304002728
'I expected to find a more\nreasonable young woman.'	1.6610868508713017
'She\nis gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay.'	1.6616477123051738
'Mr\nGardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.'	1.6617044447295695
'He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.'	1.661834939102693
'With the kindest concern he\n     came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner\n     most creditable to his heart.'	1.6619655143982397
'She will be taken good care of.'	1.6620273351283845
'You must not disappoint your father.'	1.662055491669352
'I am afraid, Mr Darcy,  observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,\n that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine\neyes.'	1.6620841107010365
'I am\nsorry it went off.'	1.6620859535465693
"After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\nBingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all\nattended her into the breakfast parlour."	1.6624933485342999
'She related the subject\nof the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the\nfurniture, in vain.'	1.662934099667206
'It is very often nothing but\nour own vanity that deceives us.'	1.6635953200449751
'You must feel it; and the usual\nsatisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because\nyou have always so much.'	1.6641663982117811
"You either chuse this method of passing\nthe evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret\naffairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures\nappear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, I should be\ncompletely in your way;--and if the second, I can admire you much better\nas I sit by the fire."	1.664248169404675
"My aunt's intelligence had given me\nhope, and I was determined at once to know every thing."	1.6642796452211923
'She was even\nsensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how\nsteadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and\nconfidence subsisted between Mr Darcy and herself.'	1.6644561864206493
'How can you contrive to write so even?'	1.6644978737981049
'Mr Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family\nprejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her\nmaster, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his\nmany merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.'	1.664961938995063
'Even Elizabeth might have found some\ntrial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the\nimprovement of her acquaintance with Mr Wickham; and nothing less than\na dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and\nMonday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia.'	1.665033872195423
"She was\nsorry that Mr Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so\nlittle suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the\nunhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him."	1.6651210550082525
'Nothing is more deceitful,  said Darcy,  than the appearance of\nhumility.'	1.66519832762469
'Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the\ndesired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of\nattachment.'	1.6652153857196321
"But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's\ndeath made her mistress of this fortune."	1.6652681395747542
'I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in\nMeryton.'	1.6653656362370275

'A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,\nsince you went away.'	1.6658722669850305
'Four sides of paper were\ninsufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of\nbeing loved by her sister.'	1.665974385099264
'I dislike it very much,  he replied;  but it must be done.'	1.666157637513366
'no, no, this is not likely.'	1.6662735343940815
'who have\noften disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my\nvanity, in useless or blameable distrust.--How humiliating is this\ndiscovery!--Yet, how just a humiliation!--Had I been in love, I could\nnot have been more wretchedly blind.'	1.666364326828168
'He must be an oddity, I think,  said she.'	1.6666004383298643
'This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too\nlate to be saving.'	1.6667361944696797

'I must conclude, for I cannot be\n     long from my poor mother.'	1.6671368109641467
'With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.'	1.6675738918724643
"Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression."	1.6677358582583075
"She saw her in idea settled in\nthat very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection\ncould bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of\nendeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters."	1.6677572342464835
"CHAPTER XVI.\n\n\nInstead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as\nElizabeth half expected Mr Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy\nwith him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's\nvisit."	1.6678394995445625
'He shook his head.-- I wish I could call her amiable.'	1.66802645696938
"In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth\ninstantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the\nvarious recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;\nbut, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\npresently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone."	1.668161123879597
'But I\ncannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly\nbestowed it most unwillingly.'	1.6681909086472004
'Your profusion\nmakes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will\nbe as light as a feather.'	1.6685554089821648
'How can Mr Bingley,\nwho seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,\nbe in friendship with such a man?'	1.6693507617204142
'Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an\ninterview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\ncalmness, if he really intended to meet them.'	1.6694705734953543
'You are\nnot well enough;--you cannot go yourself.'	1.6696503900618085
'I never saw a more promising inclination.'	1.6697595418936104
'Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was\naccepted with alacrity.'	1.6699177952058357
'And pray what sort of guardians do you make?'	1.6701084065252834
'Had he done his duty in that\nrespect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of\nhonour or credit could now be purchased for her.'	1.6701586233138668
'Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,\nfor very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to\nthink necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with\nignorance.'	1.6702544115933515
'All this she must possess,  added Darcy,  and to all this she must yet\nadd something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by\nextensive reading.'	1.6703187926448637
"The morrow produced no abatement of Mr Bennet's ill humour or ill\nhealth."	1.6703335400721784
'From Mr Collins!'	1.670375536147692
'She put down the\nletter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be\nimpartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with\nlittle success.'	1.670441677854465
'Your \nretrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment\narising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of\nignorance.'	1.6705409070942838
"Mr Gardiner gave her the\nparticulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street, and\nrepeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and\nherself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the\nacquaintance."	1.6708827134195094
'His appearance was\ngreatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine\ncountenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.'	1.6710071774671331
"We must not\nall expect Jane's good fortune."	1.6710503641160421
'CHAPTER XII.\n\n\nElizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations\nwhich had at length closed her eyes.'	1.6712390287761671
'You shall not defend her,\nthough it is Charlotte Lucas.'	1.6712478333153664
"This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by\nElizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for\nWickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling\nof displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate\ndisappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to\nthe polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to\nmake.--Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to\nWickham."	1.6713597741195287
'In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her\nhealth, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.'	1.6713698937257444
'Mary and Kitty were both with Mr Bennet:'	1.6714368459088675
'If there  were  but\nsuch another man for you!'	1.6718174523842804
"Mr Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in\nconversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high\ndiversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the\ngreatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh\nlooked that way."	1.6718182414309317
'--My mind however is now made up on\n     the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been\n     so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right\n     Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh,\n     whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable\n     rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to\n     demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be\n     ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are\n     instituted by the Church of England.'	1.6718895791265524
'They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now\nadded that of general unreserve.'	1.6719123764522832
'I suppose she had\nnothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?'	1.672012610673172
'They were, therefore, to go.--Elizabeth was pleased, though,\nwhen she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.'	1.6720475498944485
'I cannot\nacquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should\nomit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected\nwith the family.'	1.6720564261470894
'John told us Mr Darcy was\nhere when you sent for us;--was it so?'	1.6721713018715763
'I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it\nwould happen.'	1.6722016619914741
'Darcy smiled and said,  You are perfectly right.'	1.6723031450221912
'But every body is to\njudge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I\nassure you.'	1.6724079674661319
'I understand that Mr Collins has made\nyou an offer of marriage.'	1.6725158868766503
'I\n     thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his\n     society in town.'	1.6725467337833477
'END OF THE SECOND VOLUME.\n\n\n\n\n Illustration:'	1.6725579298563338
'She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist\nthe temptation, added,  When you met us there the other day, we had just\nbeen forming a new acquaintance.'	1.6726808871413708
'Bingley was by no means deficient,\nbut Darcy was clever.'	1.672709449491955
'I know not in what manner, under what form of\n     falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to\n     be wondered at.'	1.6727739638740264
'How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am I to wish you\njoy?'	1.6730146322207504
'Mr Collins\nwas employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her\nfor every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.'	1.6731368963159505
'This preservative she had now\nobtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been\nhandsome, she felt all the good luck of it.'	1.673510185178138
'There was now employment for the whole\nparty; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\nbeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected\nthem round the table.'	1.673673550904104
'No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very\ngood luck, I may meet with another Mr Collins in time.'	1.6737675263941367
'Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he\nmay never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.'	1.6738369539674236
'The very mention of any\nthing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and\nwherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of.'	1.6741459815481465
'And as to laughter, we will not expose\nourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.'	1.6743821817593518
'She was very wrong in singling me out as\n     she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on\n     her side.'	1.6743971566961238
'Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\nimagine that you are gratifying mine?'	1.674636879893904
'But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,  replied\nher uncle.'	1.6746575664819092
'Mr Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.'	1.6747933946266897
'And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr Darcy, whose\nreception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at\nbeing so addressed was very evident.'	1.674806948795458
'said Miss Bingley;  will\nshe be as tall as I am?'	1.6748419851401484
"Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin\nElizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate\nclosure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be\ninclined to take immediate advantage of."	1.6751175283376263
'And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him\nthe next moment open the front door and quit the house.'	1.6753831544020648
'He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man.'	1.6754830890240147
"She was proceeding\ndirectly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr Darcy's\nsometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,\nshe turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road."	1.6756304582829042
'Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he\nwould tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.'	1.6756851917185938
'To persuade him against\n     returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,\n     was scarcely the work of a moment.--I cannot blame myself for\n     having done thus much.'	1.6757728164143375
'While\nshe spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened\ncomplexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\nconfusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.'	1.6759021325466472
'At his own ball he\noffended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and I\nspoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer.'	1.6760736929087523
'Very odd!--And you only the\nsecond.--The younger ones out before the elder are married!--Your\nyounger sisters must be very young?'	1.6761049309773146
"I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night."	1.6762259978307066
'And  that  made the men suspect\nsomething, and then they soon found out what was the matter.'	1.6762433168820254
'It is from Miss Bingley,  said Jane, and then read it aloud.'	1.6763556466269058
'It is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--One does not know what to\nthink.'	1.676752073657032
'There are a lot of things you can do with Project\nGutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement\nand help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.'	1.6770811735855742
"On the\ngentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with\ntolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any\nsymptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance."	1.677113981503601
'How you must have hated me after  that  evening?'	1.677123531828872
'Too\nmuch , I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort\nsprings from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the\nsubject?'	1.6772164341742728
"She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to\nshare with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a\nfamily so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and\nrequiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing\ncould be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost\nimportance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience\nwas severe."	1.677258341160558
"Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching\nmarriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere."	1.6777751799288445
'Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and\nbefore he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she\ninterrupted him with,\n\n Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard,\nand if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.'	1.6778677246995592
'Mr Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many\nexpressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.'	1.6781496124995232
'Let me first see how he behaves,  said she;  it will then be early\nenough for expectation.'	1.678506430046087
'cried Elizabeth,  I am excessively diverted.'	1.6785193240691016
'Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of\nhis situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not\nvery fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone\nso material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make\nher receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances.'	1.6788398554305775
'Mr Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain\nherself, began scolding one of her daughters.'	1.6788713320634516
'My father is going to\n     London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her.'	1.679025265625924
'So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and\nasked her for the two next.'	1.6793273362488994
'My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for\nevery clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example\nof matrimony in his parish.'	1.6796016737070971
'Anxious and\nuneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the\ngentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her\nuncivil.'	1.6801397421297546
'Had she merely  dined  with him, she might\nonly have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must\nremember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four\nevenings may do a great deal.'	1.6802689816291747
'Mr Long told me last night that he\nsat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.'	1.6804083134804657
'Yes,  replied Wickham;-- his estate there is a noble one.'	1.6804488351633826
'cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her.'	1.6804711424574557
'the ladies had crowded round the table,\nwhere Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,\nin so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her,\nwhich would admit of a chair.'	1.6812751968125408
'He begins with\ncongratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of\nwhich it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping\nLucases.'	1.681516757923254
'Mr Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\nneighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he\nhad yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but\nvery intelligible gallantry.'	1.6815900438146734
'I declare I do not\nknow a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in\nparticular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening\nwhen he has nothing to do.'	1.6815965415748724
'The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the\npreservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my\nopinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily\nchanged as that implies.'	1.6816705754450456
'One came from her books, and the other from her\ntoilette.'	1.6820750628635857
'how he must have felt it!'	1.682373671155285
'Can I have the carriage?'	1.6825409511743143
"Your conduct would be quite as\ndependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were\nmounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay\ntill next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not\ngo--and, at another word, might stay a month."	1.6829834020189058
'Mr Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing\nhow  she , whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\nacceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head.'	1.6832638784690037
'Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her\nfather, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their\nunited volubility.'	1.6834714342102628
'I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take\na proper direction.'	1.6836688271658715
'Mr Gardiner himself\ndid not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was\neager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.'	1.683769708779776
'Miss\nBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\nfirst opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,\n\n Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?'	1.6838195452825033
'Nay,  cried Bingley,  this is too much, to remember at night all the\nfoolish things that were said in the morning.'	1.6838441396894313
'1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm\nelectronic work or group of works on different terms than are set\nforth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from\nboth the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael\nHart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.'	1.6841844883959132
'He then handed her\nin, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when\nhe suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had\nhitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.'	1.6847488850898718
"Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and\nwithin four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr Gardiner's\nhouse, where they were to remain a few days."	1.6847898233494356
'No really,  replied Elizabeth;  I think there cannot be too little said\non the subject.'	1.6848286395983048
'To Mr and Mr Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage\nthan to herself.'	1.6848316161524441
'By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried\n     letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not\n     confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer\n     for being coherent.'	1.6848938450012716
'Thank you,  said Lydia,  for if you did, I should certainly tell you\nall, and then Wickham would be angry.'	1.6849248566929864
'He must write his own sermons; and the time\nthat remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\nand improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making\nas comfortable as possible.'	1.6849494046220763

'In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that\nsphere.'	1.6852708299115762
'So near\na vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to\n his  easy temper, or  her  affectionate heart.'	1.6855776769445538
"It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that\nhis affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends\nsuccessfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's\nattractions."	1.685969228860473
'But I dare not\nhope it.'	1.6859806872097907

'As I must\ntherefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I\nshall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by\nsuspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.'	1.6870669299350634
"His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her\ndeserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret."	1.687100315317622
'Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,\nmerely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new\ncomers.'	1.6871660288114503
'Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to\nsuppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was\nready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very\nsincerely wish him happy.'	1.6871930661886356
'She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making\nsigns of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however\nimpenetrably grave.'	1.6874982380150356

'His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,\nhe was the admirer of some one else.'	1.6904994892258445
'But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?'	1.6905511890813638
"But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had\nbelieved it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to\nrender Mr Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a\nturn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole."	1.6907459406261107
'The bride and her mother could neither\nof them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near\nElizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,\nwith a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her\nreplies.'	1.6909055112082434
'His sisters were fine women,\nwith an air of decided fashion.'	1.6909397620105093

'This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we\n     have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject\n     it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty\n     towards Mr Wickham.'	1.691299440606304

'Balls will be absolutely\nprohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.'	1.6918603777970647
'When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very\nunwillingly said so.'	1.6919317065501394
'But may we not\nhope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks\nforward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful\nintercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater\nsatisfaction as sisters?--Mr Bingley will not be detained in London by\nthem.'	1.6920521803023496
'Read it aloud,  said their father,  for I hardly know myself what it is\nabout.'	1.6922357103895367
'Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said\nnothing.'	1.6923042153403411

'Mr Gardiner declared his\nwillingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.'	1.6928363183867536
'Yes,  thought Elizabeth,   that  would be a delightful scheme, indeed,\nand completely do for us at once.'	1.6928936971255648
'This is the last time I shall ever\nremember it myself.'	1.6930749219573753

'On the very day of my coming\n     home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor.'	1.6932769481108605
'If they had uncles enough to fill  all  Cheapside,  cried Bingley,  it\nwould not make them one jot less agreeable.'	1.6935594284475162
'It is natural that obligation should be\nfelt, and if I could  feel  gratitude, I would now thank you.'	1.693644468418179
'But you forget, mama,  said Elizabeth,  that we shall meet him at the\nassemblies, and that Mr Long has promised to introduce him.'	1.6936636154922444
"If you should have no objection to receive me\n     into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on\n     you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and\n     shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday\n     se'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as\n     Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a\n     Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the\n     duty of the day."	1.6937002335285076
'The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious\nattention.'	1.6938885292622756
'Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or\nhearing from Caroline.'	1.6938939024534745
'Of having another daughter married to Mr Collins, she thought\nwith equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.'	1.6943572884871678
'Georgiana had the highest opinion\nin the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an\nastonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of\ntalking to her brother.'	1.6944300957722862
'From something that he told me in\nour journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to\nhim.'	1.69445925506224
"But amidst\n     your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your\n     displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you\n     consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to\n     avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally\n     bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to\n     the sense and disposition of both.--I will only say farther, that\n     from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was\n     confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me\n     before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy\n     connection.--He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,\n     as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon\n     returning.--The part which I acted, is now to be explained.--His\n     sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our\n     coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible\n     that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly\n     resolved on joining him directly in London.--We accordingly\n     went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to\n     my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--I described, and\n     enforced them earnestly.--But, however this remonstrance might have\n     staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it\n     would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been\n     seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your\n     sister's indifference."	1.694897772197885
'Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing\nthe Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.'	1.6952600010778505
'There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;\nand really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly\nreasonable.'	1.6955931931369146
'Their\narrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets; and Jane more especially,\nwho gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had  she \nbeen the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must\nendure.'	1.6956488429072187
'It gives me pain\nto speak ill of a Darcy.'	1.695785829359147
'And I have another favour to ask.'	1.6958277611877954
'But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most\nnatural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging.'	1.695978357332522
'I am going to-morrow\nwhere I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has\nneither manner nor sense to recommend him.'	1.6960051038537935
'cried Elizabeth when she had\nfinished it.'	1.6960750352190053
"Little more than half a day's\njourney."	1.6963529238207717
"She had high\nanimal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the\nattentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own\neasy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance."	1.696703736528442
'He owed a good deal in\nthe town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.'	1.6967199742019499
"She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in\nsilence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for\nin Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her,\nwhich soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against\nanother."	1.6968594405605737
'- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free\n     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.'	1.696962939528704
'Here was knowledge in which no one could\npartake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect\nunderstanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this\nlast incumbrance of mystery.'	1.696980912357188
"Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she\nwatched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience\nwhich was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving\namongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be\nprevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute\nbegan another."	1.6972467526100548
'Not these two or three years perhaps.'	1.6974417026695787
'He\nonly told me, what I have now told you.'	1.697495563198484

'We are persuaded that he has pledged himself\nto assist Mr Wickham with money.'	1.6976571211046347
'To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as\nher ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.'	1.6978106817524958
'Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was\ndecided.'	1.6978310529213856
"Elizabeth listened with\ndelight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of\nBingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence\nin it."	1.6979870927542968
'But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal\nit, he must find it out.'	1.6984224832655213
'But I will endeavour to banish every painful\n     thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,\n     and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.'	1.6984507482863416
'She then sat still five\nminutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she\nsuddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,\n\n Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,  took her out of the room.'	1.6986490216966064
'There was no arguing upon such a project.'	1.6986610047976891
'But vanity, not love, has been my\nfolly.--Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect\nof the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted\nprepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were\nconcerned.'	1.6990573426819742
'Whatever my connections may be,  said Elizabeth,  if your nephew does\nnot object to them, they can be nothing to  you .'	1.6991680088647627
"From his garden, Mr Collins would have led them round his two meadows,\nbut the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white\nfrost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte\ntook her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,\nprobably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's\nhelp."	1.6993197007760834
'They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,\nwhile examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of\nmeeting its owner returned.'	1.6993201451494542
'This must be the grossest falsehood!'	1.6993600117118486

'These are conditions, which,\n     considering every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with, as\n     far as I thought myself privileged, for you.'	1.6994889870276435
"When Mr Collins could be\nforgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by\nCharlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often\nforgotten."	1.699838014603426
"This was\nvery amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth\nhad any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her\nfrom any return of Mr Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards\nherself."	1.6999960778798457
'You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its  being\ncreated .'	1.7003102604944504
'Miss Bingley said something of his never\n     returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not\n     with any certainty.'	1.7004671161966585
'After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued,  I  do  remember\nhis boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his\nresentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.'	1.7007633428906375
'And Lydia used to want to go to London,  added Kitty.'	1.7007851827397815
'My dear Mr Bennet,  said his lady to him one day,  have you heard that\nNetherfield Park is let at last?'	1.7008578980932518
'We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.'	1.7011396789641013
"I remember the time when I\nliked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so I do still at my heart;\nand if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should\nwant one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel\nForster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his\nregimentals."	1.7012113664964092
'My character has ever been\ncelebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such\nmoment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it.'	1.7013786305523138

'On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when\nhe speaks.'	1.7018765239285003
'But\nof all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom\ncould boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings,\nafforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly\nopposite the front of his house.'	1.7023058213507778
'When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,\nthey returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were\nconsigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.'	1.7024922568749998
'Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange\nwith rather more precision the degree of importance which is to\nappertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting\nbetween the parties?'	1.7025563592749116
"But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,\nlaughingly answered,\n\n No, no; stay where you are.--You are charmingly group'd, and appear to\nuncommon advantage."	1.7028197597277277
'I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.'	1.7030119144214582
"Regard for my sister's credit and feelings\n     prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr Wickham, who left\n     the place immediately, and Mr Younge was of course removed from\n     her charge."	1.7030621459177742
"Lydia was\noccasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself\nin London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently\nstaid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he\nproceeded so far as to  talk  of giving them a hint to be gone."	1.703105125456325
'His family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and\ndilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion.'	1.7031169744733503
'When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mr Forster to Meryton,\nfrom whence they were to set out early the next morning.'	1.7031291884615523
'Mr Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had\nbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character.'	1.7032897876444844
'The introduction\nwas followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a\nreadiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the\nwhole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,\nwhen the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were\nseen riding down the street.'	1.7035719898856927
"I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr Collins's\ncharacter, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my\nchance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on\nentering the marriage state."	1.7037908692157004
'My aunt Philips came to Longbourn\non Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till\nThursday with me.'	1.703825090365992
'When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely\nto her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and\nalways very short.'	1.7039014051257582
'But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,\nwhere one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no\nvery great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying\nwith the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?'	1.7039732045112201
'But not long was the interval of\ntranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she\nhad the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\npreparing to oblige the company.'	1.7040987432797319
'As a clergyman, moreover, I\n     feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in\n     all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds\n     I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly\n     commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the\n     entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side,\n     and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch.'	1.7041094838772686
'Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her\nfeatures, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very\nlittle, except in a low voice, to Mr Jenkinson, in whose appearance\nthere was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening\nto what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\nher eyes.'	1.7041419017486334
'Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table\nwhere a few books were lying.'	1.7041688141226246
'It was a large, well-proportioned\nroom, handsomely fitted up.'	1.7041754214537583
'Mr Jones says we must not think of moving her.'	1.7045702480220544
'Such a circumstance could only\nexasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her\ncheeks, and she said,\n\n In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\nexpress a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however\nunequally they may be returned.'	1.7050986625862952
'The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were\ndiscussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.'	1.7051935831785

"She has a very good notion\nof fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's."	1.7053109076314705
'Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious\npart of each was when the post was expected.'	1.7057554712741867
'You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if I\nwent to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.'	1.7061883813435232
'How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so\ndesirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for\nhappiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own\nfamily!'	1.706391391944868
'But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his\ncharacter, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next\nmorning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw\nhimself at her feet.'	1.7063946077549457
'Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,  said she,\n did he come at all?'	1.7063967000456906

'cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat\nas she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a\nmoment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was\nopened by a servant, and Mr Darcy appeared.'	1.7073372295305178
'I am astonished,  said Miss Bingley,  that my father should have left\nso small a collection of books.--What a delightful library you have at\nPemberley, Mr Darcy!'	1.7076085913212495
'There was now an interest,\nhowever, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible,\nthat the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four\nyears old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be\nhastily rejected.'	1.707684688371018
'Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his\ncountenance!'	1.7077799141332741
"Were it for nothing but his love of you, I\nmust always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your\nhusband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me."	1.707986176021584

"When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's\ncharacter, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had\nseldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it\nalmost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful."	1.7084538691539601

'Her niece was,\ntherefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\non the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\nprogress was slow, for Mr Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\ntaste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the\noccasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man\nabout them, that he advanced but little.'	1.7101609681314225
'I never\nin my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses.'	1.7103534638220828
"On being made acquainted with the\npresent Mr Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of\nthat gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree\nwith it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard\nMr Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured\nboy."	1.7105082819671211
'The\nquiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas\nof happiness!'	1.7107513546556339
'Your surprise could not be greater than  mine  in being noticed by you.'	1.7108914174872751
'I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of\nthing.--Young women should always be properly guarded and attended,\naccording to their situation in life.'	1.7109190591355257
'I never saw any one so shocked.'	1.7109894734866395
'She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening\nwith an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.'	1.7110391291156806
'With all these circumstances to\nfavour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest\nJane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness\nof so many?'	1.7110645013996806
'But do not be cast down.'	1.7113423045598537
'Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up\nstairs together.'	1.71138646948716
"The\nhall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised;\nand his commendation of every thing would have touched Mr Bennet's\nheart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his\nown future property."	1.711766488146413
'MY DEAR SIR,\n\n      I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation\n     in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now\n     suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter\n     from Hertfordshire.'	1.7118666330725056
'While the contents of the first\nletter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that\nWickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for\nmoney; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared\nincomprehensible.'	1.7118898031005498
'On entering the drawing-room she found the whole\nparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting\nthem to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the\nexcuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay\nbelow with a book.'	1.7119720152758486
'And who is there, whatever might be\ntheir former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,\ntill it were proved against them?'	1.711991414175509
'Having said thus much, I feel no\n     doubt of your secrecy.'	1.7124019997609483
'said\nJane.-- I certainly saw Mr Darcy speaking to her.'	1.7124043822470199
'You must send John with\nthe young ladies, Mr Collins.'	1.7124913555580903
'Upon my word,  said her Ladyship,  you give your opinion very\ndecidedly for so young a person.--Pray, what is your age?'	1.7125749203875338
'Mr Gardiner\nexpressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be\nbeyond a walk.'	1.712664627575768
'Had his character been known, this could not\nhave happened.'	1.7127456693955017
'After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know\nany thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that\nit was time to be at home.'	1.712751013144517
"Mr Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my\n     sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot\n     help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a\n     strong inducement."	1.7127573079332485
'Bromley, of course.--If you mention my name at the Bell,\nyou will be attended to.'	1.7127677637314982
'Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to\njoin with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but\nElizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention\neven from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,\nthan a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs.'	1.7128580639499813
'said her mother.'	1.7129288803295952
'There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\ngive me no hope from law.'	1.7130976125285973
'Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from\nCharlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.'	1.713286406334166
'I cannot but wonder,\n     however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at\n     all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.'	1.7133099943868224
'She expected every\nmoment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.'	1.71335359910446
'Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with\nall her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.'	1.7141395238384165
'Her thoughts were all fixed on that\none spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr Darcy then\nwas.'	1.7145573842106807
"It would vex me, indeed, to see you again\nthe dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard."	1.714592637091842
"On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the\nfirmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion."	1.7147791055520363
'Painful recollections will\nintrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled.'	1.714958861768263
'I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year\nor two.'	1.7152337591036748
'my dear brother,  replied Mr Bennet,  that is exactly what I\ncould most wish for.'	1.7155409134734845
'Elizabeth hoped she had\nsilenced him; but he soon afterwards said,\n\n I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.'	1.7155510457786054
'Every disposition of the ground was\ngood; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered\non its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace\nit, with delight.'	1.7155910474552094
'This is not\nthe sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his\nwife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true\nphilosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.'	1.715751675212631
"we had such a good piece\nof fun the other day at Colonel Forster's."	1.7159252894870056
'But, really, I know not what to say.'	1.7160503842681503
"For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more\n     particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our\n     near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of\n     the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted\n     with every particular of these transactions."	1.716158053169606
'--She could have added,  A young man too, like  you , whose very\ncountenance may vouch for your being amiable --but she contented\nherself with  And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from\nchildhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest\nmanner!'	1.7163646800463566
'On this point she was\nsoon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they\nparted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of\nJane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that\nmight lead to the mention of her, had he dared.'	1.7165246156776526
'The walk being here less\nsheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they\nmet.'	1.716542607534914
'Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.'	1.716550256230024
'Miss Bennet was therefore\nestablished as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such\ncommendation to think of her as he chose.'	1.7166180634619685
'The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was\nsaid of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on\nJane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred.'	1.7167630848328983
'The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and\nshopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.'	1.716805375854107
'Darcy was delighted with\ntheir engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of\nit.'	1.7171491477353322
'After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a\nlively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr Darcy, drawing near\nElizabeth, said to her--\n\n Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an\nopportunity of dancing a reel?'	1.717412389938562
'But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be\nobserved in them for ever.'	1.7176545977300204
'My object  then ,  replied Darcy,  was to shew you, by every civility\nin my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped\nto obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you\nsee that your reproofs had been attended to.'	1.717728463433899
'The loss of her daughter made Mr Bennet very dull for several days.'	1.7178389946350276
'And there was my\naunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if\nshe was reading a sermon.'	1.7180010801929702
"By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a\nwoman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not\nalways allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself."	1.7180258155466646
'Soon after\n     you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what\n     part of London they were.'	1.7180329734252442
'Nay,  said Elizabeth,  this is not fair.'	1.7180332769032076
'How good it was in you, my dear Mr Bennet!'	1.7182860568230471
'They were certainly no friends to\nhis acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have\nchosen so much more advantageously in many respects.'	1.7184257621550725
'Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more,\nand was grateful to her uncle for saying,\n\n There are very few people of whom so much can be said.'	1.7185641094351516
"To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was\npossible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her\nbrother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish\nwhich Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\nhereafter her own."	1.7189357230407456
'But it must not, shall not be.'	1.7190085165137339
'You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates\nof my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look\non as a point of duty.'	1.7192335153044356
'She is a handsome girl, about\nfifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly accomplished.'	1.7192424674349378
'He did look at it and into it for half an\nhour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied\nwith what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.'	1.7193121750500306
'I am quite well.'	1.7193203789590963
"But if you have got them to-day,  said Elizabeth,  my mother's purpose\nwill be answered."	1.7194213754433623
'I grieve to\n     find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their\n     marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he\n     feared W. was not a man to be trusted.'	1.7194279122351586
"Four weeks were to pass away\nbefore her uncle and aunt's arrival."	1.7194954865397745
"But Mr Bennet, who had calculated on\nher daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which\nwould exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive\nthem with pleasure before."	1.7195016456374146
'Not at all,  he replied;  they were brightened by the exercise.'	1.7196213655239874
'And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?'	1.7199134742513391
'While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend\nthe day with them.'	1.7199811233076352
'of which we have been advertised by the same authority.'	1.7203366992324105
'Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an\nexpression of mingled incredulity and mortification.'	1.7206285570313775
'He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we\ncannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a\npartner?'	1.7206458917812562
'Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\nPemberley by purchase than by imitation.'	1.7206635020570789
'My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.'	1.7211190986083973
'To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,\nand who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine\ntheir own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the\ninterval of waiting appeared very long.'	1.7211760110655756
'Mr Darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can\n     spare from me.'	1.721178195432407
"You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,'\nthat you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always\ndelight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of\ntheir premeditated contempt."	1.7211814409074702
'The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing\non the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the\ncarriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their\nfaces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of\ncapers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.'	1.7212995893240681
'And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters\nbehind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the\nwinter is over.'	1.7213085787160773
'But if  we  do not venture, somebody else will; and after\nall, Mr Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as\nshe will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will\ntake it on myself.'	1.721630120957855
'They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her\nuncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by\nthemselves.'	1.722123979370752
'She looked at her father to entreat his\ninterference, lest Mary should be singing all night.'	1.722149937355116
'That is capital,  added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.'	1.7221804336742736
'Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said\nless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;\nnor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.'	1.7225522816890257
'With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion\ncontinued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.'	1.7226031144608642
'This is the estimation in which you hold me!'	1.7229217539948318
'How shall we punish him for such a speech?'	1.723224969985418
'She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and\ncambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had\nnot Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her\nfather was at leisure to be consulted.'	1.7232996952092507
'With a strong\nprejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of\nwhat had happened at Netherfield.'	1.723307049368859
'On entering the room, he seemed to\nhesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile:'	1.7234750459226618
"Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded\nof her sister's ready acquiescence."	1.7236450269783006
'But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what\nI think of persons you esteem.'	1.7242360685185714
'She knew but little\nof their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness\nwhich must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time\nafter receiving his explanatory letter.'	1.7243475149234426
'They must be a great loss to  your  family.'	1.7244679648052135
'It would have suited\nme in every respect.'	1.7246942516658679
'She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the\ncard party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.'	1.7248910389398882
"All were struck with the stranger's air,\nall wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if\npossible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of\nwanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained\nthe pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same\nspot."	1.7249965551948334
'What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the\nproposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now\nhave been gladly and gratefully received!'	1.7251263953838063
'She does not yet leave her dressing-room.'	1.7251490587915441
'This was agreed to, and Mr Philips\nprotested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\ntickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.'	1.7254979033535547
'The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received\nfrom Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,\nif not by himself, such a hope was cherished.'	1.7257512312091083
'I should never be happy without\n     him, so think it no harm to be off.'	1.7258353334652579
'Then,  observed Elizabeth,  you must comprehend a great deal in your\nidea of an accomplished woman.'	1.726033346291667
'The\nsubject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went\naway.'	1.7260469771708236
'But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the\ngood-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from\nall the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit\nin this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her\nmisery was considered certain.'	1.7260970924104473
'cried Maria, after a few minutes silence,  it seems but\na day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have\nhappened!'	1.7261484043105828
"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,  said Darcy in\na less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour."	1.7264024511238798
'she was dying to know what could\nbe his meaning --and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand\nhim?'	1.7265582513664652
"You  are  a gentleman's daughter."	1.7266517471476106
'Miss Bingley\nsucceeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr Darcy looked\nup.'	1.7266964364080406
'He studies too much for\nwords of four syllables.--Do not you, Darcy?'	1.7267139391380895
"Mr Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency."	1.7267741399037577
'Let me thank you again and again,\nin the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced\nyou to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the\nsake of discovering them.'	1.7268070987139998
'He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be\nsaid.'	1.727228654023848
'Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down\nagain to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.'	1.7272406430628109
'To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle\naway like other young men.'	1.7274141348262302
'Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade\nin Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the\nhonour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty.'	1.7275180155017893
'I have not been accustomed to such\nlanguage as this.'	1.7275647458760464
'An union of a different tendency, and\nprecluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their\nfamily.'	1.7275768168521755
'She is all affability and condescension, and I\ndoubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when\nservice is over.'	1.7278112639713956
"He stood by her, however, for\nsome minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering\nto Elizabeth again, he walked away."	1.7279244153686508
"In such an exigence my uncle's advice and\n     assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately\n     comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness."	1.7280038606950523
"She examined into their employments, looked at their work,\nand advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement\nof the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she\naccepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding\nout that Mr Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family."	1.7280302778386158
'My temper I dare not vouch\nfor.--It is I believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the\nconvenience of the world.'	1.7284497922497921
'He was a tall,\nheavy looking young man of five and twenty.'	1.7284911091608859
'You know not, you\ncan scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some\ntime, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.'	1.7285562776009498
"of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance!"	1.7288228211505512

'That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.'	1.7293739093799823
'I am not indebted for my present happiness to\nyour eager desire of expressing your gratitude.'	1.7294415409894617
"My brother admires her greatly already, he will have\nfrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her\nrelations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's\npartiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most\ncapable of engaging any woman's heart."	1.7295665584466833
"Mr Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was\neagerly calling out, while her daughter read,\n\n Well, Jane, who is it from?"	1.7296916038787284
'Mr Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred\nthousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,\nbut did not live to do it.--Mr Bingley intended it likewise, and\nsometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a\ngood house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those\nwho best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\nremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to\npurchase.'	1.7298653091848613
'When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;\nbut every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.'	1.7299429010717002
'It is Mr Bingley\nI am sure.'	1.7299836762792007
'If I were as rich as Mr Darcy,  cried a young Lucas who came with his\nsisters,  I should not care how proud I was.'	1.7301056709036398
'I always said it must be so, at last.'	1.730112940287536
"It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to\nmake such an awkward business of it."	1.7301129722119277
'Lord, how ashamed I should be of not\nbeing married before three and twenty!'	1.7304002014364974
'But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\naccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry\nelsewhere?'	1.730409113560539
"Bingley urged Mr Jones's being sent for\nimmediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could\nbe of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most\neminent physicians."	1.7304528463691848
'Mr Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\npassing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too\nmuch engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas\nwas his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.'	1.7304779282988025

'Mr Bennet\nwondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much\ntrouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again.--But their\nfather, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really\nglad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.'	1.7307493311309416
'His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had\neither been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying\nhis vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most\nincautiously shewn.'	1.7308277805803158
'Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,\nbetween the mercenary and the prudent motive?'	1.7309851494419426
'She had even condescended to advise him to\nmarry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had\nonce paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly\napproved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed\nto suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.'	1.7310199729779605
"If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been,  said\nElizabeth,  and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall\nexactly know what Mr Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has\nnot sixpence of his own."	1.7310413082601053

"Mr Darcy often acknowledged himself to\nbe under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance,\nand when immediately before my father's death, Mr Darcy gave him a\nvoluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to\nbe as much a debt of gratitude to  him , as of affection to myself."	1.7324803238815523

'Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely\nrecollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which\nhad been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have\nfixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.'	1.7325519448884124

'Mr Darcy has not authorised me to\nmake his communication public.'	1.733851961449895
'He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he\ncertainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,\nto counterbalance these advantages, Mr Darcy had considerable patronage\nin the church, and his cousin could have none at all.'	1.734108909147608

"Mr Bennet's best\ncomfort was, that Mr Bingley must be down again in the summer."	1.734984464497214
'But though Bingley and Jane\nmeet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they\nalways see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that\nevery moment should be employed in conversing together.'	1.7350924845265916

'Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant\na situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by\nmentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and\nendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,\nby the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she\nwas readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the\nhappiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character\nof Mr Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.'	1.737235810789102
'Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no\ncompensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing\nhow much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her\nformer lover.'	1.7373123120356304
'Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mr Bennet would have been\nvery miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was\nnot alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her\nrestoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.'	1.737704008062639
'Mr Bennet\nwas restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June\nKitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without\ntears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by\nthe following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to\nmention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious\narrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in\nMeryton.'	1.737798996485082
"Lady Catherine had been rendered so\nexceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that\nCharlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till\nthe storm was blown over."	1.737866910104974
'Mr Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her\nDerbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.'	1.737985799164469
'Thus much for my general\nintention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\nwere directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I\nassure you there are many amiable young women.'	1.7380147333450455
'Mr Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from\nColonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.'	1.7380450705249384
'I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have\n     done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but\n     to say the truth, I was too cross to write.'	1.7381031868343735

'That he was  surprised  by the\nconnexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so\nfar from going away, turned back with them, and entered into\nconversation with Mr Gardiner.'	1.7383115194142653
"She was\ngoing to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on\nWednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be\nkilled."	1.7386094982793472

'What a contrast between him and his friend!'	1.738756082321479
'The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing\ncivilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a\ncompliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than\ngratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before\nher mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage\nwas exceedingly agreeable to  her .'	1.7389210726476652

"It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were\nassembled."	1.740024980221966
'This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted:'	1.7402184220376407
'Mr Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her\nhand; but in vain.'	1.7402214643393168
'Family pride, and  filial  pride, for he is very proud of what\nhis father was, have done this.'	1.740278137970275
"Mr Darcy may\nperhaps have  heard  of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would\nhardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its\nimpurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr Bingley\nnever stirs without him."	1.7404202758983707
'It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he  should .'	1.7404204883036942
'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last\nnight, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she\nfelt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some\nfamily objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her\nconsent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.'	1.7404227387041185
'About a year ago, she was taken from\n     school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last\n     summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate;\n     and thither also went Mr Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there\n     proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mr\n     Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by\n     her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,\n     whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his\n     kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe\n     herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.'	1.7405698258626507
'You will not find\nhim more favourably spoken of by any one.'	1.7407325435925718
'She is the sort of\nwoman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.'	1.7408012639426416
'After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every\nvariety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities,\nand reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and\nso important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her\nat length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of\nappearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such\nreflections as must make her unfit for conversation.'	1.7408331884770956
"Anxiety on Jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr\nDarcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good\nopinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost."	1.7409115048751047
'Though he had\ndetected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry\nin her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and\npleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those\nof the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.'	1.7409552919614264
'Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,\nand down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest\nof this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the\ngarden gate.'	1.740978197818878
'They attacked him\nin various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and\ndistant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at\nlast obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour\nLady Lucas.'	1.7412368835677439
'Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards\ntook occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,\nwhether  all  her sisters were at Longbourn.'	1.7414297638794165
"The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir\nWilliam's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his\neyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and\nJane, who were dancing together."	1.7416891549041091
'We live in so different a part of\ntown, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go\nout so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,\nunless he really comes to see her.'	1.7417751754828763
"The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,\nand all the articles of plate which Mr Collins had promised; and, as he\nhad likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by\nher ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish\nnothing greater.--He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted\nalacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir\nWilliam, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law\nsaid, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear."	1.7419816520154623
'About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready\nfor a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in\nconfusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up\nstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.'	1.742392808827626
'but from what the report of\ntheir engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;\ntill she recollected that  his  being the intimate friend of Bingley,\nand  her  being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the\nexpectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply\nthe idea.'	1.742452216384169
'In vain did she entreat him to stand up with\nsomebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.'	1.7424697106963754
'The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his\nfigure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own\nfeelings, followed them in silence.'	1.7426259292704773

'Elizabeth\nnoticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an\nattention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.'	1.7428766305049737
'But pride--where there is a real\nsuperiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.'	1.7430469970923024
'Mr Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the\ndelightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of\nsettlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly\nsee her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four\nmonths.'	1.743069604676372
'Mr Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor\nagreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be\nimaginary.'	1.7430995524364619
'Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\ndeclared that they were miserable.'	1.7432289805869077
'When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having\npromised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.'	1.743246019839274
'But at last your uncle was forced\n     to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,\n     was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,\n     which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your\n     letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an\n     explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give\n     the praise where it was due.'	1.7432950356690684
'Mr Wickham, after a few moments,\ntouched his hat--a salutation which Mr Darcy just deigned to return.'	1.7434290221344917
"It is Mr Wickham's intention to go\n     into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still\n     some who are able and willing to assist him in the army."	1.7434300020529265

'You must\ngive me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of\nbelieving what I say.'	1.7438229720577467
'I do not pretend to\nregret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my\ndearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many\nreturns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean\nwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most\nunreserved correspondence.'	1.7440587143608652

'But when they had withdrawn, he said to her,  Mr\nBennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and\ndaughter, let us come to a right understanding.'	1.745429154918537

'But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\nneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.'	1.7467561240064005
'It is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them\n     both---- \n\n Then it is, as I always hoped,  cried Jane;  they are married!'	1.7468393823657498
'Mr Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes\nconversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with\ntears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous\nconduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage;\nblaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the\nerrors of her daughter must be principally owing.'	1.7468853034805092
'There is\none point, on which I want your advice.'	1.747354061104965
'The conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr Darcy\ninvite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he\nchose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same\ntime to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\nthe stream where there was usually most sport.'	1.7474611264343227
'If you believed it impossible to be true,  said Elizabeth, colouring\nwith astonishment and disdain,  I wonder you took the trouble of coming\nso far.'	1.7475003753001142
'His sense of her inferiority--of\nits being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had\nalways opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed\ndue to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to\nrecommend his suit.'	1.7477561600782037
'But on the third morning after his\narrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window,\nenter the paddock, and ride towards the house.'	1.7478471240647009
'Mr Darcy is all politeness,  said Elizabeth, smiling.'	1.7480734831284526
'Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about\nthe room.'	1.7481017965632537
'In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an\nhour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the\nopportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to\nsatisfy.'	1.7481766665792755
'Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\nHertfordshire this winter.'	1.7489161286294748
'She talked to Elizabeth again and again;\ncoaxed and threatened her by turns.'	1.7489552240124617
'But before they heard again from Mr Gardiner, a letter arrived for\ntheir father, from a different quarter, from Mr Collins; which, as Jane\nhad received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,\nshe accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his\nletters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.'	1.7490671021417443
'I will not encourage\nthe impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.'	1.7492102952397002
'They were more disturbed,\nmore unequal, than she had often seen them.'	1.749847747385977
'They are in the same profession, you know; only in different\nlines.'	1.7501937637797693
'It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with\nease, cannot write ill.'	1.7503671340040257
'And tell my dear\nLydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen\nme, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.'	1.7504880016847668
'Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of\nthe letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the\nwriter, that could give her any comfort.'	1.7505490515686872
'She was then but\n     fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her\n     imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to\n     herself.'	1.7511544791323232
'The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia,\ndepended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though\nthey each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr\nWickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and\na ball was at any rate, a ball.'	1.7514250555426905
'In\ntalking over their route the evening before, Mr Gardiner expressed an\ninclination to see the place again.'	1.7514485063540066
'But that is nothing to us.'	1.7514640024870307
'You must not blame my aunt.'	1.7515420091436522
'His coming into the country at all, is a\nmost insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.'	1.7520132442680711
'It would have spared her from\nexplanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;\nbut they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of\nher attachment to Mr Darcy.'	1.7521658899007027
'They could\nhave been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the\nsame.'	1.7521955708563857
'cried Jane,  what do you mean, Sir?'	1.7522771931857348
"She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation\nbetween Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr Philips's."	1.7524249022599272
'But the morrow\npassed off much better than she expected; for Mr Bennet luckily stood\nin such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak\nto him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark\nher deference for his opinion.'	1.7524760969085975
'Yes; but when questioned by  him  Denny denied knowing any thing of\ntheir plan, and would not give his real opinion about it.'	1.7525071961118979
'CHAPTER XIV.\n\n\nDuring dinner, Mr Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants\nwere withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his\nguest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to\nshine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.'	1.752714627645961
'But Jane knows, as well as I do, what\nWickham really is.'	1.752726719857719
'My youngest of all, is lately married,\nand my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man,\nwho I believe will soon become a part of the family.'	1.7527944983266635
'Indeed, Mr Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention\nall that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me\nleave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,\nand such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear.'	1.7528976870658572
'It is only that he is blessed with\ngreater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally\npleasing than any other man.'	1.7529617933446515
'Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was\ndelighted.'	1.753019358463819
'CHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nMr Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,\ninstead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for\nthe better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived\nhim.'	1.7532892389398702
'Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as\nacute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr Darcy had been, was much\nrelieved by discerning such different feelings.'	1.7533284190330867
'Mr Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no\nmore, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account\nfor it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it\nwith less perplexity.'	1.7533458357912175
'My visit was\nnot long, as Caroline and Mr Hurst were going out.'	1.7535227210551938
'Putting\naway the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,\n\n I did not know before that you ever walked this way.'	1.7535322511333085
'Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing\n     but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed\n     him to act as he has done.'	1.7535704907707794
"There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle\nsensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of\ntheir acquaintance."	1.7538504255962883
'Mr Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly\nsuperior to his sister, as well by nature as education.'	1.753914991020009
'Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with\nmuch more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the\nend of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by\nScotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with\nsome of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing\nat one end of the room.'	1.7539582566916077
'He could not speak a word for full ten\nminutes.'	1.7542243947799614
'Give my love to Colonel Forster, I hope you\n     will drink to our good journey.'	1.7544115035516121
'She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means.'	1.7544289038481247
'When I consider,  she added, in a yet\nmore agitated voice,  that  I  might have prevented it!-- I  who knew\nwhat he was.'	1.7544337132227577
'Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people\nin whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\nfelt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or\npleasure.'	1.7545812863746097
'Mr Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the\nrest, and talked only to each other.'	1.7547983080843927
'This invaluable friend was a\nvery young woman, and very lately married.'	1.7550158579568975
'I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or\nother, and not disturb us with his company.'	1.7551234794150559
'But now it was all too natural.'	1.7552926615754878
'He had before believed her to return his\n     affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--But Bingley has\n     great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment\n     than on his own.--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived\n     himself, was no very difficult point.'	1.755359840867477
'He added, that Mr\nBennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and\npromised to write again very soon.'	1.7553822343010208
'No, my dear; I think not.'	1.7553825694018268
'I declare after all there is no\nenjoyment like reading!'	1.7553841111597486
'She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through\nMeryton, thought she might as well call on you.'	1.7557697072068086
'He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.'	1.7561533410585448
"Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;\nand Mr Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and\nrings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss\nBennet."	1.7562796993191174
"As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was\nordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their\nboxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and\nLydia's purchases, were seated in it."	1.7564579310802901
'Supposing him to be attached to\nme, would  my  refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it\non his cousin?'	1.7565567483622258
'He cannot know what Mr\nDarcy is.'	1.7565569241534145
'Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of\nthe moment, been led to make Mr Darcy acquainted with their fears for\nher sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper\ntermination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its\nunfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the\nspot.'	1.7565746564981077
"His affection for\nher soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in\nspite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to\nreputation which her marriage had given her."	1.7565942790366837
'Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to\nColonel Fitzwilliam,  Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of\nme, and teach you not to believe a word I say.'	1.7566471842633855
'In every thing else she is as\ngood natured a girl as ever lived.'	1.7566570894371452
"As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it\ntaken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"	1.7568236744424404
'As\nfor Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth\nwith a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at\ntable,\n\n This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.'	1.7568586736565344
"It had come\nwith a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a\ngentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be\nremarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham."	1.7571819654646295
'The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly\nfor denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as\nhaving passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first\ndisapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind\nthan on hers.'	1.7571964794300454
'I\ncannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my\nacquaintance, that are really accomplished.'	1.7572248295486965
'The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had\ngiven him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good\ndeal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in\nretirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected\nprosperity.'	1.7575805627575678
'Mr\nCollins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured\nwith unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.'	1.7576377380386978
'As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and\nshook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;\nand he soon afterwards said aloud,  Mr Bennet, have you no more lanes\nhereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?'	1.7576473443622058
'In the first place,  replied Mr Gardiner,  there is no absolute proof\nthat they are not gone to Scotland.'	1.7578205261554714
'A promise\nof secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept\nwithout difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst\nforth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some\ningenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great\nself-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.'	1.7578856847069577
"The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had\nproduced of what Mr Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's\nmatch, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too\ngreat to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the\npain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!"	1.7579841006719221
'In\nterms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though\nexpressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\napprobation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\nengagements that had been made for him.'	1.7581950987148975
'Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he\nspoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his\nenquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay\nin Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the\ndistraction of his thoughts.'	1.7585612418976586
'At that instant she felt,\nthat years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for\nmoments of such painful confusion.'	1.758563576058215
'But I have\nother provocations.'	1.7587805190210064
'The\nevening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its\nanimation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and\nElizabeth.'	1.7588488409794258
'However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his\nfirst entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds\nof the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful\nproperty of some one or other of their daughters.'	1.7589570699645263
'Very little was said by either; Kitty was\ntoo much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a\ndesperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.'	1.7592726785150887
'And\nwhen we  do  return, it shall not be like other travellers, without\nbeing able to give one accurate idea of any thing.'	1.7594779480526792
'If you received the work electronically, the person or entity\nproviding it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to\nreceive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.'	1.7595644401040034
'Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.'	1.7595762285126548
'Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners\nwere always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been\nexactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he\nclaimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.'	1.7596501469660086
'The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,\nabout a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.'	1.7597036565040516
'That  she  could\nbe in any danger from the deception never entered my head.'	1.7599503659479427
"He was resolutely silent however; and, from a\ndetermination of making him speak, she continued,\n\n I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all\nwere to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect\nyour saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, ' She \na beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she\nseemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at\none time."	1.7599977713993877
"But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good\nof every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of\nthe bad--belongs to you alone."	1.7600731668247256
"During their walk, it was resolved that Mr Bennet's consent should be\nasked in the course of the evening."	1.7602487773745323

'I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling\n     myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both,\n     cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation,\n     and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been\n     spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.'	1.7602989116038723
'She\nhad never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural\nbeauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.'	1.7603134337393067
'She\ncomplained bitterly of all this to her husband.'	1.7604712188811633
"Lydia has no\nbrothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's\nbehaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever\nseemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that  he  would\ndo as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in\nsuch a matter."	1.7604925178294073

'By many significant looks and silent\nentreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of\ncomplaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an\nopportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.'	1.761374426369445
'I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am\ngrowing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.'	1.7614208850925632

'What\ncould be more natural than his asking you again?'	1.7628869546926813
'Her\ndisappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her\nsister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could\nnever be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as\nBingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.'	1.7631296127174598
"Mr\nBennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's\ninterruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would\nresume his book; but Mr Collins, after assuring them that he bore his\nyoung cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any\naffront, seated himself at another table with Mr Bennet, and prepared\nfor backgammon."	1.7631660086368741
'She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all\nher chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.'	1.7631866510004333
'The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\nentrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the\nfinest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a\nsignificant look and smile from Mr Annesley to Miss Darcy had been\ngiven, to remind her of her post.'	1.7634484752708484
'and Mr\nForster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow\none of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!'	1.7635043206963061

'My dearest Lizzy,\n\n      I FIND myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be\n     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.'	1.7641625203436107
'CHAPTER XIV.\n\n\nThe two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr Collins having\nbeen in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was\nable to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very\ngood health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the\nmelancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings.'	1.7644219248773096

'I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably\nwell, when she came into the room this morning.'	1.7660721021043457
'Jane was not deceived, but she was\naffected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing\nher a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.'	1.7661787443908408
'She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery\n     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be\n     found.'	1.7663294000113234
'I wish you very happy and very rich, and by\nrefusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.'	1.766467656137372
'The darling wish of his\nsisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county\nto Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source\nof happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.'	1.7668955790411058
'There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at\nthe will of others.'	1.7672422939945989
'Elizabeth received her\ncongratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took\nrefuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.'	1.767384355124732
'Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,  added\nCharlotte,  and a most attentive neighbour.'	1.7673844454622352
'As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back\nto look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was\nconjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself\nsuddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.'	1.7679039915150574
'You \nmay ask questions, which  I  shall not choose to answer.'	1.767999573543804
'There was\nnovelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such\nuncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change\nwas not unwelcome for its own sake.'	1.7680078207709127
'It had given him a\ndisgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and\nquitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a\nmile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he\ncould think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by\nbusiness, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.'	1.7680178414309615
"How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from\none's own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr\nCollins too!--Why should  he  have it more than anybody else?"	1.7681495778632919
'There are a few\nthings that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\neven without complying with the full terms of this agreement.'	1.7682052822445835
'Mr Darcy asked him why he had not married your\n     sister at once.'	1.7685981944752434
'Charlotte did not stay much\nlonger, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.'	1.7692172532544104
'The rest of the evening passed with the  appearance , on his side,\nof usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish\nElizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a\nmutual desire of never meeting again.'	1.7694198592298864
'I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.'	1.76954034698162
"They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr\nBingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their\nmother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of\nan ensign."	1.7697299274270677
"She felt anew the justice of Mr Darcy's\nobjections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his\ninterference in the views of his friend."	1.7700470283043803
'No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely\nresolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more\nnecessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\nsaw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\nand that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\nwhen he first came into the room.'	1.7705641638527132
"She saw instantly that her\ncousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility\nwas just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate\nto hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family."	1.7709739101722974
'You appear to me, Mr Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of\nfriendship and affection.'	1.7714736469948327
'Some time or other he  will  be--but it shall not be by  me .'	1.7715549801783674
'She\nsaw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at\npresent unknown.'	1.7716293867680555
'He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\nagreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly\nwith a large party.'	1.7717179198743218
'Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,  said Elizabeth,\ncoolly,  will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report\nis in existence.'	1.7717431305759805
'Very, very much.'	1.772120353707076
'Elizabeth privately added,  And how much I shall have to conceal.'	1.7722629638236123
'Our distress, my\n     dear Lizzy, is very great.'	1.7722967500025708
'Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with\nher two elder sisters.'	1.772637626458292
'Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and\nthat it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.'	1.7728278469118577
'Miss Bingley was\nengrossed by Mr Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr\nHurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to\neat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish\nto a ragout, had nothing to say to her.'	1.7730723088484701
'Mr Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,\nis he?--Poor Eliza!--to be only just  tolerable .'	1.7730734157292323
'I shall tell Colonel\nForster it will be quite a shame if he does not.'	1.7733297981221068
'We will go as far as Meryton with you,  said Catherine and\nLydia.--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set\noff together.'	1.7733917842535476
'As yet, she\ncannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its\nreasonableness.'	1.7735232435047308
'Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases\ncame to meet Maria and hear the news:'	1.7736095190275691
'There was a\nsomething in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive\nand anxious attention, while she added,\n\n When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that\neither his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from\nknowing him better, his disposition was better understood.'	1.773641850159462
'MY DEAR BROTHER,\n\n      At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such\n     as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction.'	1.7736597371137757
'I appeal to Mr Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,\nSir.--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching\nconverse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.'	1.7737438059597768
'Miss Elizabeth Bennet!'	1.7740507667689982
'With  your \ngood sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of\nothers!'	1.7740752569865914
'He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to\nentertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her\nthat all was safe, her wit flowed long.'	1.7741831305025866
'He was on one side of her mother.'	1.774222836257347
'Do not give way to useless alarm,  added he,  though it is right to be\nprepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.'	1.774270875030465
'She had always seen it with pain; but\nrespecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of\nherself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to\nbanish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation\nand decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own\nchildren, was so highly reprehensible.'	1.7743103402389173
'CHAPTER X.\n\n\nMore than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly\nmeet Mr Darcy.--She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that\nshould bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever\nhappening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a\nfavourite haunt of hers.--How it could occur a second time therefore was\nvery odd!--Yet it did, and even a third.'	1.7743703603952874
'From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and\nwere indebted to Mr Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went\nalong, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,\nwhich he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened\nalmost every day.'	1.774423950248998
'He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his\nintrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to\nbe within.'	1.7745278961979571
'Four nieces\nof Mr Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and\nit was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who\nwas merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite\ndelighted with her.'	1.774729299710978
"One day's delay she observed,\nwould be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite\nso obstinate as usual."	1.7749538881139957
'The turn of your countenance I shall never\nforget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible\nway, that would induce you to accept me.'	1.775117154826599
'Sir, you quite misunderstand me,  said Mr Bennet, alarmed.'	1.7752072264507168
'He resigned all\n     claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could\n     ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three\n     thousand pounds.'	1.7752375476630247
'What I have to say relates to\n     poor Lydia.'	1.7752739363023964
'Lydia--the\nhumiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up\nevery private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,\nElizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of\nseveral minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the\nvoice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke\ncompassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,  I am afraid you have been\nlong desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my\nstay, but real, though unavailing, concern.'	1.775404419024836
'She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.'	1.7754796382045608
'While I can have my mornings to myself,  said she,  it is enough.--I\nthink it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.'	1.7755512318282618
"He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading\nMr Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her\nat last to go--saying, as she quitted the room,  If any young men come\nfor Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure."	1.7756184202691332
'Mr Bingley does not know Mr Wickham himself?'	1.77574078601049
"She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady\nCatherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter\nCharlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room."	1.7757798165129466
'Mr Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching\nthe progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by\nmessages to his sister.'	1.7760851272886493
'I began to be afraid you would never come back again.'	1.7762297727280367
'At our time of life, it is not so\npleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but\nfor your sakes, we would do any thing.'	1.7764020379601004
'You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!'	1.7764203691467848
'Mr Bennet rejoiced to see Jane\nin undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr Bennet\nsay voluntarily to Elizabeth,\n\n I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.'	1.7766879748946858
'Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,  said her father,  to send for the\nhorses?'	1.776797971326121
'The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every\nfemale of the family.'	1.7768312592340465
'Not that\nI care about it, though.'	1.7768675272490648
'I wish I could see her.'	1.776920781943919
'But we are none\nof us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger\nimpulses even than pride.'	1.7771053552185556
'Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from\ndoing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.'	1.7773097937476565
'CHAPTER XV.\n\n\nOn Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr Collins met for breakfast a few\nminutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of\npaying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.'	1.7780938085443485
'So high and so conceited that there was no enduring\nhim!'	1.7781328683639654
'On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very\npretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and\nlightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but\njust done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the\nroom, when last at Pemberley.'	1.7783797706845328
'Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?'	1.7787440755980237
"The comfort to  her ,\nof the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression."	1.7788893406131585
'CHAPTER II.\n\n\nAfter a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr\nCollins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of\nSaturday.'	1.7791920737825975
'I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by\nhis coming.'	1.7792387876174254
'And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself?'	1.7794552103017567
"The arrival of letters was\nthe first grand object of every morning's impatience."	1.779827738309145
'Mr Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and\naffectionately taking her hand, said in reply,\n\n Do not make yourself uneasy, my love.'	1.7798878063031525
'We have judged it best, that my\n     niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will\n     approve.'	1.7800329380524698
'He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and\naffection of a sister.'	1.7801617382486759
'Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the\nvisit.'	1.780173279064922
"Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after\nhalf an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join\nthe others with tolerable composure."	1.780441914092752
'Mr Hurst looked at her with astonishment.'	1.7804700535299829
'He has also  brotherly  pride,\nwhich with  some  brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful\nguardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the\nmost attentive and best of brothers.'	1.7808744756941082
'He was too happy, however, to need much attention;\nand luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them\nfrom a great deal of his company.'	1.7810004344851649
'And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a\ndoubt, I suppose, of their being really married?'	1.7812541154745318
'Reflection must be\nreserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it\nas the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk,\nin which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant\nrecollections.'	1.7812646797164065
'How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains!'	1.7812913054236703
'And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the\nBarnet road.'	1.7813296616481378
'The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;\nand, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card\ntable in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of\nthe first.'	1.7813830081154602
'Her character\nwill be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt\nthat ever made herself and her family ridiculous.'	1.781397085689828
'You must decide for yourself,  said Elizabeth,  and if upon mature\ndeliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is\nmore than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by\nall means to refuse him.'	1.781543870845178
"Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to\nElizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of\nit;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any\nsatisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante."	1.7817503443061786
'In his library he had been\nalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told\nElizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the\nhouse, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,\nwas most prompt in inviting Mr Collins to join his daughters in their\nwalk; and Mr Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker\nthan a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and\ngo.'	1.7819666345365617
"CHAPTER XIX.\n\n\nHad Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could\nnot have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic\ncomfort."	1.782080806044198
'My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour\nto  you  was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke\nto you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.'	1.782638328977343
"CHAPTER VII.\n\n\nSir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough\nto convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of\nher possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met\nwith."	1.7826782002054138
'Elizabeth however did not chuse to\ntake the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\nconsequence of any reply.'	1.7827757951771939
'You know pretty well, I suppose,\n     what has been done for the young people.'	1.782834856122768
'Heaven forbid!-- That  would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To\nfind a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--Do not wish me\nsuch an evil.'	1.782980711455748
"There were\nfew people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;\nbut at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's\nfrailty would have mortified her so much."	1.783136423926627
"But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity\n     of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given\n     the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her\n     temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--That I was\n     desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will\n     venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually\n     influenced by my hopes or fears.--I did not believe her to be\n     indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial\n     conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.--My objections to\n     the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged\n     to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my\n     own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to\n     my friend as to me.--But there were other causes of\n     repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to\n     an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to\n     forget, because they were not immediately before me.--These causes\n     must be stated, though briefly.--The situation of your mother's\n     family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that\n     total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed\n     by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by\n     your father.--Pardon me.--It pains me to offend you."	1.7831500718482116
'These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have\nexperienced many hardships of that nature.'	1.783173903761768
'I know little of the game, at present,  said he,  but I shall be glad\nto improve myself, for in my situation of life----  Mr Philips was\nvery thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.'	1.7832076434674973
"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's\nimmediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour."	1.7832891025469872
'Mr Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a\nletter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately\nfound out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street.'	1.783404794208499
'He was her dear Wickham on every\noccasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.'	1.783546322608797
'Mr Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted\nby the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,\nhis arrival was no great inconvenience to Mr Bennet.'	1.7836504743290218
'for I dare not hope,  he continued in a lower and more\nserious tone,  that he is improved in essentials.'	1.7837820177236432
'exclaimed Elizabeth,  you are too good.'	1.7839068395437208

'I am very, very sorry.'	1.7857099152164584
'She grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--Of neither Darcy nor Wickham\ncould she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,\nprejudiced, absurd.'	1.7860522972486144

"To Mr Bennet's\nacknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to\npromote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties\nthat the subject might never be mentioned to him again."	1.7872854835974814
'On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the\nhall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to\nwonder at her being where she was.'	1.7873379849361284
'On that head,\ntherefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that\nno ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.'	1.7874082411240448
'We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us,  said Mr\nGardiner,  but perhaps to the Lakes.'	1.7874124345998108
"Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's\nconsideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it\nover as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried\nto conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided\nbetween distress and diversion."	1.7875108593604125
'It was a painful, but\nnot an improbable, conjecture.'	1.787542958179925
'Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but\nLydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,\ndetained first by the civility of Mr Collins, whose inquiries after\nherself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little\ncuriosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending\nnot to hear.'	1.787725866731264
'The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed\none of the gates into the ground.'	1.7877968753510836
'If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill\nfrom the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and\nit will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the\ndark.'	1.78788064347873
'Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk\nby herself.'	1.7880164570795805
'It drew from her,\nhowever, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually\ndone before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in\nthe country at present.'	1.7881759315464185
"Every thing being settled between  them , Mr Darcy's next step was\n     to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in\n     Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home."	1.7882667588805847
"She remembered also, that till the Netherfield\nfamily had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but\nherself; but that after their removal, it had been every where\ndiscussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr\nDarcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the\nfather, would always prevent his exposing the son."	1.788589693052495
'Not that  I  think\nCharlotte so  very  plain--but then she is our particular friend.'	1.7889167868431421
'After a short pause,\nher companion added,  You are too generous to trifle with me.'	1.789061266148088
'Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the\nprincipal object.'	1.7894937904435493
'The more I see\nof the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms\nmy belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the\nlittle dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit\nor sense.'	1.7896086981992854
'yes;--there is nothing in that.'	1.7896719961333065
'He had ruined for a\nwhile every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart\nin the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have\ninflicted.'	1.7896838965551625
'Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed,  To\ntreat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his\nfather!'	1.7897476054971928
'Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all\nlikely to make her more elegant.'	1.7897681812207875
'The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mr Bennet had time to\ntell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in\nmomentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed\ntheir all walking out.'	1.7898825672853191
'I am sorry to pain you--but so it was.'	1.7905408346431
'As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they\nshould ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had\nmarked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a\nretrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of\ncontradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those\nfeelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would\nformerly have rejoiced in its termination.'	1.7912849425808357
'No one but Jane, she thought,\ncould flatter herself with such an expectation.'	1.7913007531775664
'We both know that he has been profligate in every\nsense of the word.'	1.7914413380987857
"My father was not\n     only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always\n     engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the\n     church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it."	1.7915871576074105
'Imprudent as a marriage between Mr Wickham and our poor Lydia\n     would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for\n     there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.'	1.7915877232434143
'She blushed at the very idea; and\nthought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run\nsuch a risk.'	1.79171111873957
'I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,\nand am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.'	1.7918278727982129
"Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer\nabove-mentioned; and while Mr Darcy was attending them to their\ncarriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on\nElizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress."	1.7918672959744881
'Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;\nand Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever\ndared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.'	1.792041023127585
'We had better go into the\navenue.'	1.7921286972546175
"For your\nsake,  turning to Charlotte,  I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no\noccasion for entailing estates from the female line.--It was not thought\nnecessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family.--Do you play and sing, Miss\nBennet?"	1.7921287752476867
'My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you\ncertain?'	1.7923929384263788
'She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of\nbringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away\nwithout enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than\nthe mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.'	1.7925111645647718
'After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was\ntempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and\nlook into the park.'	1.7928489009300776
'I do assure you that I am not\none of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so\ndaring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second\ntime.'	1.79319123950681
'It suddenly struck her that it might\nbe from lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the\nconsequent explanations.'	1.793228394322557
'But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that\ncheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,\nproceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly\ndisposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded.'	1.7933564117879286
'And\nwhat do you think she said besides?'	1.7938274820659263
'The very last evening was spent\nthere; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of\ntheir journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,\nand was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right\nway, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the\nwork of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.'	1.7939004353209975
'I need not explain myself farther; and\n     though  we  know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she\n     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so\n     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may\n     feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable.'	1.7943011554469424
"On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,\nshe added,  Very well; if it must be so, it must."	1.7943938489559939
"She\nsoon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding\nto the efforts of his aunt, who  did  call on him in her return through\nLondon, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the\nsubstance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on\nevery expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension,\npeculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that\nsuch a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from\nher nephew, which  she  had refused to give."	1.7945272291683003
"As they drove to Mr Gardiner's\ndoor, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when\nthey entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,\nlooking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and\nlovely as ever."	1.7945704764496955
'He is gone to my father already.'	1.7947255326565903
"Mr\nBennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage\nbefore Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr Bingley\nand his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very\nwell.--Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively\nresolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the\ncontrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,\nshe urged Jane to borrow Mr Bingley's carriage immediately, and at\nlength it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield\nthat morning should be mentioned, and the request made."	1.7948709527286095
'She performed her part\nindeed without much graciousness, but Mr Bennet was satisfied, and\nsoon afterwards ordered her carriage.'	1.7948965265550623
'If you do not agree to abide by all\nthe terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy\nall copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.'	1.7949319686308671
'In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your\nfeelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\nestate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.'	1.7951107333191918
'As long as she stays\nthere, it is all very well.'	1.7951716445964072
'Sure he\nwill not leave London before he has found them.'	1.7961004686039022
'The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his\nside, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason\nto hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day\nwould be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.'	1.7964188319657468
'That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was\nanother very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to\nhave as little trouble in the business as possible.'	1.796655175168751
'Elizabeth saw directly that her\nfather had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were\nat the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often\ndisheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.'	1.7969249936620622
'There\ncan be no occasion for your going so soon.'	1.7969309180532251
'I should be sorry indeed, if it were.'	1.7969526311551345
'Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though\nher resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such\ndisapprobation.'	1.7969775399459447
'Do you suppose them to be in London?'	1.7970208534385814
'But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill.'	1.7974912002210028
'At last it\narrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr Darcy, with\nsuch a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,\nwhen he looked at her.'	1.7977768560733562
'The\nwish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his\nfeeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a\nblow as this.'	1.7977777698878228
'He had not been long seated\nbefore he complimented Mr Bennet on having so fine a family of\ndaughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this\ninstance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did\nnot doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.'	1.7979043977575158
'Let me advise you then, my dear Sir,\n     to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy\n     child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the\n     fruits of her own heinous offence.'	1.7980734267563592
'In\ntruth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble\nparsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it an object of\ncompassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.'	1.7981810909568336
'You need not send them word at\n     Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the\n     surprise the greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia\n     Wickham.'	1.798357976999812
'They were able to love each\nother, even as well as they intended.'	1.7985494986641168
'Elizabeth again, and more\nseriously assured her of its truth.'	1.7985646336795151
'It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.'	1.798572322292424
'Her astonishment at his coming--at his\ncoming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,\nwas almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered\nbehaviour in Derbyshire.'	1.7986536215313507
'With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr Wickham and the\nofficers, Mr Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the\nyoung ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a\nkind listener in Mr Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most\nabundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.'	1.7987174499052512
'She could only imagine however\nat last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about\nher more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than\nin any other person present.'	1.7989333996766153
'Mr Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some\nrefreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,\ndeclined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,\n\n Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness\non one side of your lawn.'	1.7993416943175524
'They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me\nto determine.'	1.799496604399864
"Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated\nlook; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his\nembarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of\naccents,\n\n You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr Darcy, will readily\ncomprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume\neven the  appearance  of what is right."	1.7996159649227759
'Her heart was divided between concern\nfor her sister, and resentment against all the others.'	1.7996161885353574
'My dear Mr Bennet,  cried his wife,  what are you\ntalking of?'	1.7996202342936543
'But Mr Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours\nin the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in\nher hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till\ndinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the\nhousekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.'	1.7997529616660963
'They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to\nhave their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as\npossible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your\nlife.'	1.7998411572632256
'With a glance she saw,\nthat he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his\npoliteness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;\nbut she had not got beyond the words  delightful,  and  charming,  when\nsome unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of\nPemberley from her, might be mischievously construed.'	1.8000129765218404
'On both sides it was only assertion.'	1.8000546831196802
"This\nunfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure\nof seeing you at Pemberley to-day."	1.8000794756586933
'It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among\nher companions.'	1.8000816877784882
'Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give\npleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest\nemotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.'	1.8004908093838106
'An express came at twelve last night, just as we were\n     all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was\n     gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,\n     with Wickham!--Imagine our surprise.'	1.8008253186550895
'She had been watching him the last hour,\nshe said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr Wickham\nappeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation,\nbut unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the\nofficers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become  stupid,\ndisagreeable fellows.'	1.800864758520471
'Elizabeth\nwas not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and\npleased.'	1.8011813503333898
'CHAPTER V.\n\n\n I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,  said her uncle, as they\ndrove from the town;  and really, upon serious consideration, I am much\nmore inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the\nmatter.'	1.8011889624286157
'My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.'	1.8018348171675196
'Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,\nhe really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of  my  being\nindifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!'	1.8018758783712725
'his\njudgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as\nto leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than\nlovely and amiable.'	1.8019316461046528
'You may readily comprehend,  she added,  what my curiosity must be to\nknow how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively\nspeaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such\na time.'	1.8019492905013175
'What do you mean, Mr Bennet, by talking in this way?'	1.8019770023922417
"When the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies\nall rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when\nall her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her\nmother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated\nwith the rest of the party."	1.8020239901673083
'I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\nthat noble place.'	1.8020429374462756
'She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each\ncalled during her absence; Mr Darcy, only for a few minutes to take\nleave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least\nan hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her\ntill she could be found.--Elizabeth could but just  affect  concern in\nmissing him; she really rejoiced at it.'	1.8020780241767842
'It taught me to hope,  said he,  as I had scarcely ever allowed myself\nto hope before.'	1.8021358954253826
'It is on your account that he has been\nso frequently invited this week.'	1.8022115561911562
'The\nhappiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never\nfelt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as\nwarmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.'	1.8025169017235092
'It was first broken by Mr Annesley, a\ngenteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind\nof discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the\nothers; and between her and Mr Gardiner, with occasional help from\nElizabeth, the conversation was carried on.'	1.8026085044126516
'The gentlemen\npronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was\nmuch handsomer than Mr Bingley, and he was looked at with great\nadmiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust\nwhich turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be\nproud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his\nlarge estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\nforbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared\nwith his friend.'	1.8026219514776245
'She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked\nup and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks\nof enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.'	1.8026393488492358
'Every idea that had been brought\nforward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she\nstood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes\nupon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of\ngratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and\nsoftened its impropriety of expression.'	1.8030604431325568
"I want to know,  said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\nsister's,  what you have learnt about Mr Wickham."	1.8030847290913714
'They look upon it\nquite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.'	1.8032563972264501
"But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures\ncontinued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving\nhome."	1.8032883707333052
'She knew not what to think, nor how to\naccount for it.'	1.8033129019829557
'She follows him to\ntown in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he\ndoes not care about you.'	1.8033289100311132
'The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of\nher wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of\naccomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those\nattendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and\nservants.'	1.8034435725162115
'Towards  him  I have been\nkinder than towards myself.'	1.8035248467912068
'All that is known after this is, that they were seen\n     to continue the London road.'	1.8035251859693648
'No one but Mr Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and\nshe made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and\nhaving very frequent parties at home.'	1.8035373586568963
'Kitty and\nLydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr Collins was only a\nclergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news\nto spread at Meryton.'	1.8035534045737351
'I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,  replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise\nand emotion,  that you have ever been informed of what may, in a\nmistaken light, have given you uneasiness.'	1.8036339769497671
"Mr Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed\nElizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books\nthat lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr Darcy's eyes were fixed\non her."	1.8037890938321688
'Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.'	1.8041681374606522
"The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous\nconviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;\nand she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained\nhimself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to\nherself; when her father continued,\n\n You look conscious."	1.804390733537222
'It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood\nperfectly ignorant of what had happened.'	1.8044126536443397
"Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a\nwelcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mr Collins's pretty friend had\nmoreover caught his fancy very much."	1.8050581454139794
'As she went up stairs to get ready, Mr Bennet followed her,\nsaying,\n\n I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that\ndisagreeable man all to yourself.'	1.8050967918230112
"Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and\nElizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid\nher anxiety had done no good.--Others of the party were now applied to."	1.8051343348219542

'What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment.'	1.8055199784554992
'His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards\nMr Darcy with a very expressive smile.'	1.8057092453025878
'There has\nbeen many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.'	1.8057579263540144
"I am\nafraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr Darcy's\nregard."	1.8057682630444665
'There is a gentleman with him, mamma,  said Kitty;  who can it be?'	1.8058403792974413

'He had never had the\nslightest suspicion.'	1.8064160560497695
'Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his\nfriend.'	1.8065208721960608
'As it was certain, however, that\nsomebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid\nthe confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the\nshrubbery.'	1.8066805516683533
'It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there\nten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it\nseemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to\npropriety, not a pleasure to himself.'	1.806702678016425
'His debts are to be paid,\n     amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,\n     another thousand in addition to her own settled upon  her , and his\n     commission purchased.'	1.806867986178498
'There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his\nletter, which promises well.'	1.8069576204948448
'At Brighton she will be of less importance\neven as a common flirt than she has been here.'	1.8070216675697337
"From the entrance hall, of which Mr Collins pointed out, with a\nrapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed\nthe servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine,\nher daughter, and Mr Jenkinson were sitting.--Her Ladyship, with great\ncondescension, arose to receive them; and as Mr Collins had settled it\nwith her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was\nperformed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks\nwhich he would have thought necessary."	1.8073626760963413
'For\n     about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the\n     incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied\n     to me again by letter for the presentation.'	1.8074014114429355
'Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your\nambition will ever be gratified.'	1.8074906341526584
'When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them\na good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;\nand Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her\nhand to both.'	1.8077984245855443
'Mr Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal\npeople in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,\nwas angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one\nhimself at Netherfield.'	1.8078551123150304
'I cannot be\n     otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your\n     amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to\n     assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but\n     of this hereafter.'	1.8080938830537094

'Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only  child )\nI was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father\nparticularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,\nalmost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond\nmy own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to\n wish  at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with\nmy own.'	1.8083001801841947
'This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being\neagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.'	1.8083799300243841
'But when they see,\nas I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will\nlearn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we\ncan never be what we once were to each other.'	1.8084010371917765

'Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any\none; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived\nherself.'	1.809305154116478
'My real purpose was to see  you , and to judge, if I could, whether I\nmight ever hope to make you love me.'	1.8099293971326285
'Can she be ignorant of what you\nand Jane seem so well to understand?'	1.8099900339579205
'This fine account of him,  whispered her aunt, as they walked,  is not\nquite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.'	1.8100375111128788

'They are gone down to\nNewcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to\nstay, I do not know how long.'	1.8100891431905362
'He\n     meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future\n     situation, he could conjecture very little about it.'	1.8101140984534567
"But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained\nin any doubt of your sister's sentiments."	1.8106005344821505
'Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her\nuncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their\nfavourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.'	1.810897506767788
"Mr and Mr Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,\nby the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but\nsatisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the\ncause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on\nthe postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had\nnever been a favourite with them, Mr and Mr Gardiner could not but be\ndeeply affected."	1.8109601225766236
'Not at all,  was her answer;  but depend upon it, he means to be severe\non us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing\nabout it.'	1.811106717541904
'It was a subject, in short, on\nwhich reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.'	1.8111812195568338
'Elizabeth\nhad hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did\nnot appear in the least affected by it.'	1.811327519948282
'A man of honour could not have doubted the\nintention, but Mr Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\nconditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\nto it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.'	1.8113792845978365
'She was less handsome than her brother, but there\nwas sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\nunassuming and gentle.'	1.811583331754789
'She had not at first thought very seriously of\ngoing thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan,\nand she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure\nas well as greater certainty.'	1.8116649037817558
'Mr Bennet could not give her consent, or\nspeak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,\nthough she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when\nMr Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed\nhow really happy he was.'	1.8119487774364593

'He heard her attentively, and then said,\n\n Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public\nplace or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little\nexpense or inconvenience to her family as under the present\ncircumstances.'	1.8122505273487992
'I am sorry to say it of\nthem, but so it is.'	1.8124340849957767
'But let me advise you to think better of it.'	1.8124449312967483
'However, I did not hear above one word in ten,\nfor I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham.'	1.8129154425623726
'He brought it with him for us to see.'	1.8130116529684208
'I would not on any\naccount trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it\nfrom any one but myself.'	1.8130278069914145
'But it is,  returned she;  for Mr Long has just been here, and she\ntold me all about it.'	1.8131246457838812
'My situation in life, my connections\nwith the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are\ncircumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther\nconsideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no\nmeans certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.'	1.8131383914462011
'Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,\nthat I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in\nmarriage.'	1.8131843119089273
"Mr Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr Collins for\na few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation\nwere very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh."	1.813407197610979
'I am not now to learn,  replied Mr Collins, with a formal wave of the\nhand,  that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the\nman whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their\nfavour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a\nthird time.'	1.813563206587005
'At such a distance as  that , you know, things are strangely\nmisrepresented.'	1.8137137770199758
'Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment\nof her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many\nof the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on\nthe business.'	1.8137489174404136
'Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed\nthe bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mr Gardiner,\nwho was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of\nreturning to the carriage as quickly as possible.'	1.8137682081539899
'She was on the point of continuing her walk,\nwhen she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which\nedged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr\nDarcy, she was directly retreating.'	1.8141141111349175
'He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter,\nwhich she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure,  I\nhave been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.'	1.8141208960201727
'When I wrote that letter,  replied Darcy,  I believed myself perfectly\ncalm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a\ndreadful bitterness of spirit.'	1.8141668136576643
'You must not suspect me.'	1.8142649071892765
'Mr Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table\ncould divide them.'	1.8143301677304335
'Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very\noften.'	1.8143392579569821
'If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often\nseemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might\nsettle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity\nunblemished could make him.'	1.8148919077063985
'But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she\nsaw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother\nhad been too ingenious for her.'	1.8148957569927189
'I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.'	1.8153052843246487
'Bingley met them with hopes\nthat Mr Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.'	1.8153384057070863
"She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a\nsolidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no\nmeans so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and\nimprove himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very\nagreeable companion."	1.8155312639491241
'Five daughters brought up at home\nwithout a governess!--I never heard of such a thing.'	1.8156350930504075
'His cousin was as absurd\nas he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,\nmaintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,\nand except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in\nhis pleasure.'	1.8156418785585604
'She danced four\ndances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,\nand has since dined in company with him four times.'	1.8159701658116216
'Yes, and I had heard it before.'	1.816155649286149
'He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\nfrom a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to\nconjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known\ntill its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost\nsecure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,\nhe was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.'	1.8165112510327075
'But you are not entitled to know  mine ; nor will such behaviour as\nthis, ever induce me to be explicit.'	1.8166680777433726
'How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr Darcy,  she cried;  I\nnever in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.'	1.816698210770659
'Her teeth are\ntolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which\nhave sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing\nextraordinary in them.'	1.8169985823046482
"She asked her at different times, how many sisters\nshe had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of\nthem were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they\nhad been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her\nmother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her\nquestions, but answered them very composedly.--Lady Catherine then\nobserved,\n\n Your father's estate is entailed on Mr Collins, I think."	1.8175876384891076
'If your abhorrence of\n      me  should make  my  assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented\n     by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may\n     be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find\n     some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course\n     of the morning.'	1.8176837019802423
'That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\nresentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her\nmarriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe\npossible.'	1.8179875574656474
'One cannot wonder that so\nvery fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour,\nshould think highly of himself.'	1.8183904077924493
"It convinced her, that\naccident only could discover to Mr Bingley her sister's being in town."	1.8184458441847358
"She was at least free from the offence of Mr Darcy's farther notice;\nthough often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\ndisengaged, he never came near enough to speak."	1.818546742754672
"When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment\nshe soon found some resemblance of Mr Darcy, she turned her eyes on the\ndaughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment, at her\nbeing so thin, and so small."	1.8185569345428076
'I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\nno want of subject.--We may compare our different opinions.'	1.8188403406732148
"From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr Darcy\nhad been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mr Gardiner's\nlong letter, but now, having  that  to communicate which she knew would\nbe most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt\nhad already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as\nfollows:"	1.8189448966065667
'He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any\none, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and\nhe was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his\nassistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.'	1.8189962890251605
'It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and\ninterest, for him to be guilty of it.'	1.819733104344817
"Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more\ninterest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer\nMr Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided\nopinion, that whenever Mr Collins should be in possession of the\nLongbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife\nshould make their appearance at St. James's."	1.8201398788811047
'In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!'	1.820158999171397
'While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the\ndoor bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its\nbeing Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in\nthe evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her.'	1.8205958148411172
'But, \nshe continued, recollecting herself,  as we know none of the\nparticulars, it is not fair to condemn him.'	1.8207566986299564
'Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little\nattention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near\nthe card-table, and stationed herself between Mr Bingley and his eldest\nsister, to observe the game.'	1.8211435347236322
'Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\naffectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive\nfrom me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of\nyour regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.'	1.8211854564802414
'Jane was as much gratified by this, as her\nmother could be, though in a quieter way.'	1.8215826487833537
'You do not make allowance enough for difference of\nsituation and temper.'	1.821954656834813
"His character sunk on every\nreview of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible\nadvantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr\nDarcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly\nregret what he had thrown away."	1.8220312189226928
"The present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for\nthe lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be\nfairly conjectured from  that , though Elizabeth, who was by this time\ntolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware,\nthat, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of\nLydia's infamy somewhat better."	1.8223793882724706
'Instead of\nviewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and\nwelcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--But no, --recollecting\nherself,-- that could never be:'	1.8224873011855747
'Having thus\noffered you the sincere congratulations of Mr Collins and myself on\nthis happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another:'	1.8229721473999627
'Mr Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained\nwonder, and when at last Mr Collins allowed him time to speak, replied\nwith an air of distant civility.'	1.8230890249023968
'We have reason to imagine\nthat his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with\na friendly eye.'	1.8231621900497736
'But to be sure,\nthe good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming\ncharacter!'	1.8233858703899026
"Rendered\nspiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to\nhis brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and\nleave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable\nfor continuing their pursuit."	1.8235207289186508
"The promised\nletter of thanks from Mr Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their\nfather, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a\ntwelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted."	1.8236566475805644
'Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to\nthe utmost to speak with composure when she said,\n\n You are mistaken, Mr Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your\ndeclaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the\nconcern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a\nmore gentleman-like manner.'	1.8238669567329198
"It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's\ninterested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those\nwishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man\nso totally independent of every one."	1.8240188036570544
'I will read it to you--\n\n When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which\ntook him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we\nare certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when\nCharles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have\ndetermined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend\nhis vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.'	1.8240616003143637
'Come, Darcy,  said he,  I must have you dance.'	1.8246440924266818
'I have by no means done.'	1.8248365824881687
'It was some consolation to\nthink that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,\nand a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be\nwith Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her\nspirits, by all that affection could do.'	1.8249298049229319
'They were in fact very fine ladies; not\ndeficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of\nbeing agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.'	1.8249742278389673
'for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great\nbooks, and make extracts.'	1.825078927989077
'She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a\nprudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.'	1.8252387292775938
'Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,  said Mr Collins\nvery gravely-- but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all\ndisapprove of you.'	1.825388816585928
'yes--it would be much better to\nwait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter\nwould be at Meryton again.'	1.82561571439345
'Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is\ncharming.'	1.8256412789804857
'How soon any other wishes\nintroduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an\nhour after I had seen you.'	1.8259999054584422
"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I\nassure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's."	1.8260553610935633
'I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider\nyour situation with much compassion.'	1.8260595535697592
"My dear Friend,\n\n      If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and\n     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our\n     lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never\n     end without a quarrel."	1.8260966011572297
'But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it\nwas impossible not to try for information.'	1.8265397489365436
'CHAPTER XX.\n\n\nMr Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\nsuccessful love; for Mr Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule\nto watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the\ndoor and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she\nentered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in\nwarm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.'	1.8267189009833278
'It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you\nmust confess.'	1.826888859269416
'From what we have seen of him,  continued Mr Gardiner,  I really\nshould not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by\nany body, as he has done by poor Wickham.'	1.8271003295018435
"Your sister I also watched.--Her look and\n     manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any\n     symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the\n     evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with\n     pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of\n     sentiment.--If  you  have not been mistaken here,  I  must have\n     been in an error."	1.827105400630889
'That is the most unforgiving speech,  said Elizabeth,  that I ever\nheard you utter.'	1.82721167975676
'Through letters,\nwhatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every\nsucceeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.'	1.8273817878765448
'He was very fond of them.'	1.8277567051998085
'In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\nnothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter\nwas unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she\nagain began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and\ncommanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.'	1.8278581367391957
'A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de\nBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he\nfelt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,\nmingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a\nclergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of\npride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.'	1.8280379880784505
'I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get\nover it immediately.'	1.828251620174568
'He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably\ngood spirits.'	1.8282625113672126
"Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\nwithout anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried\nhim through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the\ntruth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the\nmost forbearing courtesy."	1.828354014752334
'and with the\nknowledge of your ill opinion too!'	1.8285559952343395
'Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the\ngentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.'	1.8285700571505714
'He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could\n     so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed\n     seeing him, till after the departure of the former.'	1.8288027408577203
"While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different\ndoors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much\nobjected to be kept waiting for her dinner.--Such formidable accounts of\nher Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,\nwho had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her\nintroduction at Rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had\ndone to his presentation at St. James's."	1.8290378135043155
'You may depend upon it, Madam,  said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,\n that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she\nremains with us.'	1.8291976862590822
'This son was to join\nin cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow\nand younger children would by that means be provided for.'	1.8294027932279266
'The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was\nenough to provoke him.'	1.8295835324162324
'To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\nshall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\naware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\nin the 4 per cents.'	1.8297003023125589
'No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she\nhad almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,\nthat could be so called.'	1.8301509006235115
"If you were aware,  said Elizabeth,  of the very great disadvantage to\nus all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and\nimprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you\nwould judge differently in the affair."	1.8302601596817505
'They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to\nimagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at\nfirst was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would\nbe the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made\nsome slight observation on the dance.'	1.8302840061229084
'Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was\nthe case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed\nand rejoiced in his domestic comforts.'	1.8304145283824054
'If you\ndo not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the\nrules is very easy.'	1.8305422999497374
'I am\nperfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any\ndesign of engaging my affection.'	1.8305685321910892
'And can you likewise declare, that there is no  foundation  for it?'	1.8308725465092157
"Mr Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his\nforbearance; and though Mr Philips, as well as her sister, stood in\ntoo much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good\nhumour encouraged, yet, whenever she  did  speak, she must be vulgar."	1.8309676876287897
'After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two\ngentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the\nbrink of the river for the better inspection of some curious\nwater-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.'	1.831110305349938
'She had\nspent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with\nCharlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make  her \nfeel the obliged.'	1.8313740667979583
'It must not be thought of.'	1.8313798827316543
"Yes, Ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just\nas affable to the poor."	1.8316354770118721
'After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not\nhelp reverting once more to the first, and saying,\n\n I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr Bingley!'	1.8321221717278047
"She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with\nanxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to\nher eldest sister,  Ah!"	1.832376146952998
'This is delightful indeed!--She will\nbe married!--I shall see her again!--She will be married at sixteen!--My\ngood, kind brother!--I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage\nevery thing.'	1.8327148732847562
'I have found out,  said he,  by a singular accident, that there is now\nin the room a near relation of my patroness.'	1.8329378818363784
'Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for\nwhile he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else;\nbut she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those\nhours of separation that must sometimes occur.'	1.8329649154385799
'I do think Mr Long is as good\na creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,\nand not at all handsome:'	1.8330443098857063
'I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows\nhim,  replied the other.'	1.8330552449966273
'Jane was by no means better.'	1.8335917459279927
'Mr Collins and Charlotte appeared at\nthe door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a\nshort gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole\nparty.'	1.8338030980919127
'But I have always observed, that they who are\ngood-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he\nwas always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the\nworld.'	1.8338524031336307
"From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's\nsociety she was of course carefully kept, and though Mr Wickham\nfrequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of\nballs and young men, her father would never consent to her going."	1.833995601916393
'Mr Collins was eloquent in her praise.'	1.8344049600830783
'CHAPTER XXIII.\n\n\nElizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what\nshe had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it,\nwhen Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to\nannounce her engagement to the family.'	1.834408821052276
'She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.'	1.8346542498697198
'She felt it so; and though, in\nlooking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity,\ncould be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they\nhad feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they\nhad gained.'	1.8351031805532037
'Any place would do, of about three or four\n     hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr Darcy about it,\n     if you had rather not.'	1.835485992922513
'Miss Lucas perceived\nhim from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly\nset out to meet him accidentally in the lane.'	1.835514612414122
'Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;\nand she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,\n I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him\never since he was four years old.'	1.8357604243285648
"Many circumstances might make it\n     more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to\n     pursue their first plan; and even if  he  could form such a design\n     against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely,\n     can I suppose her so lost to every thing?--Impossible."	1.8359364179687316
'How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions\nin speaking of Wickham to Mr Darcy, for now they  do  appear wholly\nundeserved.'	1.836382515455814
'I\nassure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an\nagreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.'	1.8365403429006362
'Two\ninferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that\nElizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that\nshe herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two\npoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.'	1.8366724618178076
'Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do Bingley.'	1.836793381004623
'She wrote even\nto Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her\nformer professions of regard.'	1.836974943116274
'The\ntown where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where\nthey were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of\nher curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,\nDovedale, or the Peak.'	1.8370565944674286
'The journey would moreover give her\na peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have\nbeen very sorry for any delay.'	1.8371340069319537
"It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should\nform such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or\nfriendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I\nam strongly inclined to hope the best."	1.8371621853646767
'What an excellent father you have, girls,  said she, when the door was\nshut.'	1.8374129828091665
'He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,\n     and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would\n     be a very insufficient support therein.'	1.8374826717462458
'I am not so\n     selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.'	1.8375222033436214
'Smiles decked the face of Mr Bennet, as the carriage drove up to\nthe door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,\nanxious, uneasy.'	1.8376153166717906
'Lydia\ntalked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the\nfish she had won, and Mr Collins, in describing the civility of Mr and\nMr Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses\nat whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing\nthat he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage\nbefore the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.'	1.8381652476095491
'At\nthat moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\nthrough the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr\nDarcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his\ndancing and his partner.'	1.8381935118106907
'From\nwhat he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,\nreserved, disagreeable girl.'	1.838382902439344
'Yes,  replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer,  but  that \nwas only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have\nconsidered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.'	1.8385373812039378
"If I wished to think slightingly\nof any body's children, it should not be of my own however."	1.8385395948570158
'There is nothing else to be done.'	1.8385703322880222
'Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;\nand as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in\nher reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him\nlanguage so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time\nall intercourse was at an end.'	1.8388649582594119
'cried Mr Gardiner, whose curiosity\nas to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.'	1.839066085373094
'I have been used to consider poetry as the  food  of love,  said Darcy.'	1.8391652489214285
'How near it may be to  mine , I cannot pretend to say.-- You \nthink it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.'	1.8394093434704661
'At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind\nroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.'	1.839529680206348
'Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as\nhis leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having\nno feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the\nmoment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the\nobservances which he supposed a regular part of the business.'	1.839550284272324
'But he is a\nliberal master, I suppose, and  that  in the eye of a servant\ncomprehends every virtue.'	1.8397127271817575
'His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she\ncould not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or\nfeel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.'	1.8397332376711562
'My avowed one, or what I avowed to\nmyself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,\nand if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.'	1.8397703177557232
'She could see him instantly before\nher, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more\nsubstantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and\nthe regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.'	1.8398295536111406
'But whether she\nwere violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it\nwas certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to\nher sense; and she could no more bear that Mr Darcy should hear the\nfirst raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her\ndisapprobation.'	1.8399999666119324
"Had Lydia's marriage been\nconcluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that\nMr Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other\nobjection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the\nnearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned."	1.8404139270522968
"The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would\nreturn Mr Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to\ndinner."	1.840585609602375
'Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice\nof what might be called economy in her own private expences, she\nfrequently sent them.'	1.840631057677256
'Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as\nabsolutely settled.'	1.8414406682554414
"Mr Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in\nthe course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her\nsister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the\nconversation."	1.8418205826951144
'As that was the\ncase, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it\nnecessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it\napparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the\nneighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown?'	1.841895517057963
'Every thing was too recent for\ngaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any\nthing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity\nwould come in time.'	1.8419027168926945
'I never can be thankful, Mr Bennet, for any thing about the entail.'	1.8420488142522196
'Had they been\nonly ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his\ndiscrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that\nmoment alighted from his horse or his carriage.'	1.8423447271802764
'The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters\nand of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss\nDarcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for\nthe strength of his attachment.'	1.8423879965624104
'A young man, such\nas you describe Mr Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl\nfor a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets\nher, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.'	1.8425842063502582
'You and the girls may go, or you may send\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are\nas handsome as any of them, Mr Bingley might like you the best of the\nparty.'	1.8427703351174618
'Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was\nopened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for\nit.'	1.843137677237443
'Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt\nthat there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such\na quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece.'	1.8433542610561406
'And this is always the way with him,  she added.-- Whatever\ncan give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment.'	1.8434138997245035
"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,  replied Elizabeth, with\ntears in her eyes,  that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such\na point should admit of doubt."	1.8436113979337871
'CHAPTER XV.\n\n\nMr Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had\nbeen but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of\nhis life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and\nmiserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he\nhad merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful\nacquaintance.'	1.8436710597384376
'I thought it my duty\nto give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and\nher noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run\nhastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.'	1.8438915349599807
"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr Bingley,  said her mother,\n I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on Mr\nBennet's manor."	1.8440312760839401
'Mr Collins,  said she,  speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her\ndaughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,\nI suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his\npatroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.'	1.8441002142380807
"It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of\nMiss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as\nmade her look handsomer than ever."	1.8448830811582373
"She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had\na few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever\nprevailed on to get out."	1.8452326020122594
'You judge very properly,  said Mr Bennet,  and it is happy for you\nthat you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.'	1.8452371218066919
'His present pursuit could not make him forget that\nElizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the\nfirst to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner\nof bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what\nshe was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their\nopinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide,\nthere was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her\nto him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced,\nthat whether married or single, he must always be her model of the\namiable and pleasing.'	1.845292802423039
'A man who had felt less, might.'	1.8457358378376194
'Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mr Collins and\n     myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable\n     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest\n     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.'	1.8458294615970037
'Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their\nvisitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he\nturned to his daughter and said,\n\n Jane, I congratulate you.'	1.8459133446603253
"If you'll believe\nme, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a\nfortnight."	1.8462916818184991
"The very first\nsentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for\nthe winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had\ntime to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left\nthe country."	1.8465398364594043
"and various were the subjects\nwhich occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table,\nafter the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mr Bennet was\ndoubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present\nfashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,\nretailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice\nrather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various\npleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her."	1.8465431289658203
'The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change\nwas visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or\nthe anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given\nsomething more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of Kitty.'	1.8466120823474743
'It must be his own doing.--He is his own master.'	1.846784527656128
"When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr\nCollins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much\nstruck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he\nmight almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour\nat Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much\ngratification; but when Mr Philips understood from him what Rosings\nwas, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the\ndescription of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found\nthat the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all\nthe force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison\nwith the housekeeper's room."	1.846995412798927
'But though\nevery thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him\nby any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend\nthat she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion.'	1.8470361657575545
"Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force\none most reluctant smile."	1.8478410564606704
'And my aunt Philips is sure it would do  me  a great deal of good, \nadded Kitty.'	1.848179522911106
'What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself\non having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most\nimprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other\nparticulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him\nthe kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from\nknowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.'	1.8481937562930248
'Mr Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his\nreception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his\nfirst introduction.'	1.8483441855731813
'Lizzy,  cried her mother,  remember where you are, and do not run on in\nthe wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.'	1.848927962178749
'Had Elizabeth\nbeen able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the\nexpression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him;\nbut, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of\nfeelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his\naffection every moment more valuable.'	1.8491396614765125
"They\nran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the\nlibrary;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of\nseeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the\nbutler, who said,\n\n If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the\nlittle copse."	1.8491534757761565
'My friend has an excellent understanding--though\nI am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr Collins as the wisest\nthing she ever did.'	1.8491733727711348
"His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an\nadmiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded\nElizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his\nown, would be speedily secured."	1.849411842641643
'For my part, I am determined never to speak\nof it again to anybody.'	1.8495648651714989
'They must have seen them together for ever.'	1.8498127615362825
'Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a\nslight inclination of the head.'	1.8498240909749124
'But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any\nconsideration in the world,  replied Darcy.'	1.849850246420066
'said Mr Gardiner.'	1.8503224741410331
'No. It would have been strange if they had.'	1.850628286935328
'But the fact is, that\nbeing, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\nfather, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy\nmyself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that\nthe loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy\nevent takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be\nfor several years.'	1.8506716954599536
'At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mr Hurst and\nElizabeth herself.'	1.8510013294231555
"And\ngathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth\ncalled out,\n\n Dear Ma'am, do not go.--I beg you will not go.--Mr Collins must excuse\nme.--He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear."	1.8510359339325277
'Your plan is a good one,  replied Elizabeth,  where nothing is in\nquestion but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined\nto get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.'	1.8513877620074461
'Perhaps,  said Darcy,  I should have judged better, had I sought an\nintroduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers.'	1.8514382615317782
"She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to\nbe made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that  she ,\nhis favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be\nfilling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched\nreflection, and she sat in misery till Mr Darcy appeared again, when,\nlooking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile."	1.8514632514454077
'Mr Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and\nwas beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they\nwere suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth\nhappening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,\nwas all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.'	1.8515683140256505
"As a brother, a landlord, a master, she\nconsidered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--How\nmuch of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--How much of\ngood or evil must be done by him!"	1.8516368994057752
'But before I am run away with by my feelings on this\nsubject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for\nmarrying--and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of\nselecting a wife, as I certainly did.'	1.8519746041992449
'They will then join his regiment,\n     unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from\n     Mr Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all,\n     before she leaves the South.'	1.8520402356311232
'He is rich, to be\nsure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.'	1.8521622513191467
'Nothing could be more delightful!'	1.8523051764466945
"I am far from attributing any part of Mr Bingley's conduct to design, \nsaid Elizabeth;  but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others\nunhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery."	1.8523060155153037
'The certainty of\nmeeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that\nmight not unreasonably have alarmed her.'	1.852346761561126
'How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned!'	1.8523516433708382
'Mr Darcy!--and so it does I vow.'	1.852368641111981
'In the evening, soon after Mr Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw\nMr Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was\nextreme.'	1.8525210989114829
'You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr Darcy?'	1.852579840307808
'It must be something particular, to take him there at this\ntime of year.'	1.852719721506604
'But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\nthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.'	1.85278233152594
'The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she\nshould suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to\nthe other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the\ndoor.'	1.852821846015843
'Mr Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.'	1.8528457842270871
'It is a pity that great ladies\nin general are not more like her.'	1.8533401380833103
'that I had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety\nupon yourself alone.'	1.8535147988698277
'Mr Bennet, through the assistance of servants,\ncontrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety\nand fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could.'	1.8535169751160132
'That she should receive an offer of\nmarriage from Mr Darcy!'	1.8541002709733483
"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do."	1.8541392086479411
'If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my\n     impertinence.'	1.8542196260900874
'Your superior knowledge of your sister must make\n     the latter probable.--If it be so, if I have been misled by such\n     error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been\n     unreasonable.'	1.8542397466234208
'She had only to say in\nreply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own\nknowledge.'	1.8542603917669036
"In ran Mr Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing\ngown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,\n\n My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down."	1.8544533849911091
'That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a\nball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly\nbrought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.'	1.854964060858105
'I know very well, madam,  said he,  that when persons sit down to a\ncard table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I\nam not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.'	1.8549843953127287
'Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;\nand Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather  knew  that she was happy,\nthan  felt  herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,\nthere were other evils before her.'	1.8554637135835028
'She respected, she\nesteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his\nwelfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to\ndepend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both\nthat she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still\npossessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.'	1.855707871916039
'I am not going to run away, Papa,  said Kitty, fretfully;  if  I \nshould ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.'	1.8561349917156376
"Had his own happiness, however, been\nthe only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what\never manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she\nthought he must be sensible himself."	1.8563575789412008
'My \nfather began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr Philips,\nappears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use\nto the late Mr Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the\nPemberley property.'	1.856573398335538
'Elizabeth could never\naddress her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,\nand, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the\nsake of what had been, rather than what was.'	1.8565960888256887
'And then, you know, when once they get\ntogether, there is no end of it.'	1.8569548393615842
'I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;\nor me either, for that matter.'	1.8573741439097387
'His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the\ncompliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an\noccasion of introducing him to her father and mother.'	1.8575631317791774
'Well, then--supposing them to be in London.'	1.8575959851671435
'I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just\nsaid, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.'	1.8577372806464918
'I cannot pretend to be sorry,  said Wickham, after a short\ninterruption,  that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond\ntheir deserts; but with  him  I believe it does not often happen.'	1.8577545131215758
'I am sure I shall break  mine ,  said Lydia.'	1.8580116939884088
'He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my\nacquaintance, but that is all.'	1.858026143899456
'In the desperation\nof her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to\nElizabeth, said,\n\n Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a\nturn about the room.--I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting\nso long in one attitude.'	1.8581002524807395
'After discharging\nhis conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many\nrapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection\nof their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was\nmerely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready\nto close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither\nhe hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,\nhe added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take\nplace as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable\nargument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him\nthe happiest of men.'	1.858156765447185
'Mr Bennet indeed said little; but the\nladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr Collins seemed neither in need\nof encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.'	1.8585549333410925
'Lydia, my love, though you  are \nthe youngest, I dare say Mr Bingley will dance with you at the next\nball.'	1.858801913460682
'He merely added, that he should not write\nagain, till he had something of importance to mention.'	1.858846640286629
'This\nhowever was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time\ncomfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with\nCharlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she\nhad often great enjoyment out of doors.'	1.858847036357078
'Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were\nthe other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact\nnothing to do elsewhere.'	1.8589561504234051
"Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,\n     that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on  your \n     side."	1.8596052789858277
'Who would\nhave thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de\nBourgh in this assembly!--I am most thankful that the discovery is made\nin time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,\nand trust he will excuse my not having done it before.'	1.859714730568997
'After sitting\nfor a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,\n\n I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.'	1.8600429215273102
'It will be  her  turn soon to be teazed,  said Miss Lucas.'	1.8601859881686367
'But she is very young; she has never\nbeen taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,\nnay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement\nand vanity.'	1.8602999040316248
'It is\nnot likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it\nmight strike them that they could be more economically, though less\nexpeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.'	1.8605399809168386
'then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.'	1.8605583875765808
'But it is not merely this affair,  she continued,  on which my dislike\nis founded.'	1.8606163589352496
'I have suspected it some time, but\nI am now convinced.'	1.8606710256230274
'I shall not go away, till you have given me the\nassurance I require.'	1.8609134009053148
'Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke\nten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at\none time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most\nconscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.'	1.860981921098279
'People  did  say,\nyou meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope\nit is not true.'	1.86098667646853
'The chief of every day was spent by\nhim at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time\nto make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.'	1.8610310137033517
'For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.'	1.8610755399466719
'I had not thought Mr Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\nhim, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be\ndespising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\ndescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as\nthis!'	1.8612987864047892
'You are very cruel,  said her sister,  you will not let me smile, and\nare provoking me to it every moment.'	1.861641831164745
'He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again\n     on Wednesday or Thursday.'	1.861775780982011
'You will only think I feel  more  than I ought to do, when I\ntell you all.'	1.8618306725867189
'It had better have happened to  you , Lizzy; you\nwould have laughed yourself out of it sooner.'	1.8618569075784126
'You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings\nin this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.'	1.8619215402332019
'But the wife of Mr\nDarcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily\nattached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause\nto repine.'	1.8619594647590292
'What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always\ncoming here?'	1.8619636996542492
'That among his own connections he was\nesteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a\nbrother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of\nhis sister as to prove him capable of  some  amiable feeling.'	1.862118293341447
'It was reasonable, however, to\nhope, that they would not continue long.'	1.8622154019523132
'Mr Hurst and Miss\nBingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who\ncontinued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined\ntheir party in the drawing-room.'	1.8622711660587543
'He really\nbelieved, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he\nshould be in some danger.'	1.8623278355990593
'And you are\nnever to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten\nminutes of every day in a rational manner.'	1.8627417848236503
'With amazement did\nshe first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;\nand steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to\ngive, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.'	1.8628521550032768
'But I can assure the young ladies that I come\nprepared to admire them.'	1.8629347762330921
'No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to\nrain; and then you must stay all night.'	1.8632457919846943
'And yet, upon my honour, I\nbelieved what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this\nmoment.'	1.8638132919177792
'My dear Mr Bennet,  replied his wife,  how can you be so tiresome!'	1.8641278319418084
"This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman\nhimself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain\npossession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'\nconsent, there was still something to be wished for."	1.8641448083236904
'1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern\nwhat you can do with this work.'	1.864193319497285
'Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as\nElizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,\ncame up with him, and eagerly cried out,\n\n Oh, Papa, what news?'	1.8644725963728384
'Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.-- I assure\nyou, I feel it exceedingly,  said Lady Catherine;  I believe nobody\nfeels the loss of friends so much as I do.'	1.8646993569904038
'I never thought Mr Darcy so deficient in the  appearance  of it as you\nused to do.'	1.8648340796737723
'Mr Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was\nturned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated\nhimself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into\nconversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the\nprobability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,\ndullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the\nskill of the speaker.'	1.8649583571994006
'The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she\nwould, and the argument ended only with the visit.'	1.8649707633796184
'This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in\nsummer; the windows are full west.'	1.8650291063110669
'Mr Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to\nintroduce his friend, Mr Wickham, who had returned with him the day\nbefore from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in\ntheir corps.'	1.8651732409100368
'To be\nsure that  did  seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he\n did --I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something\nabout Mr Robinson.'	1.865240851908015
"Her mother's ungraciousness,\nmade the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind;\nand she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell\nhim, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of\nthe family."	1.8660313718194983
"They were all astonished; and Mr Bennet, who could by no means wish for\nso speedy a return, immediately said,\n\n But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my\ngood sir?--You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of\noffending your patroness."	1.8662951662020362
'With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held\nthere in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the\nson of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known\nfact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind\nhim, which Mr Darcy afterwards discharged.'	1.8665309046642207
'In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,\nwith occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the\nimprovements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the\ngentlemen joined them; and he found in Mr Philips a very attentive\nlistener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she\nheard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as\nsoon as she could.'	1.8669882388832535
'Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been\nsometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward\nwith impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the\nsatisfaction she had promised herself.'	1.8673203224342745
"In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's\nwords, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible\nwhisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the\nchief of it was overheard by Mr Darcy, who sat opposite to them."	1.8673263187198845
'I\nshould be sorry to think our friend mercenary.'	1.8674093680120063
'I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.'	1.8675268646196341
"It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger\ndaughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of\nother rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be\nable to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that\nshe might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked."	1.8676540253471419
'As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than\nthe last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not\nlong enough to determine her feelings towards  one  in that mansion; and\nshe lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out.'	1.8676706125548528
'Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last\nKitty did, she very innocently said,  What is the matter mamma?'	1.8680514365027234
'If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea\nof there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.'	1.8681765968577664
'but when she came to\nthe will, the difference was great.'	1.8682378635946753
'It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that\nElizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly\nexpressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied,  Say\nnothing of that.'	1.8688066870799778
'Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only\nwanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern\nin parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer\nof the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the\npresent.'	1.8690321819757265
'When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,\nthe tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mr Collins,\ngratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.'	1.869270764724497
'Mr\nHurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the\nsophas and go to sleep.'	1.8693652586774732
'You have\nwithheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for\nhim.'	1.8697032730778795
"Elizabeth made no\nanswer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which\nshe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr Darcy, and\nreading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it."	1.8700680041740625
'Mr Darcy\nis impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth,  we  are\nscarcely less eager to meet her again.'	1.870075778472083
'Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first\nconvenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,\n\n You mean to frighten me, Mr Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear\nme?'	1.8701247774799132
'I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will\nnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.'	1.8701361827905327
"But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,\nhe was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;\nand, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her\nresentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity\nto see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on\nthem at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had\nreceived, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the\nvisits of her uncle and aunt from the city."	1.8703806468911675
'Almost as\nsoon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my\nfuture life.'	1.8704617689122602
'Had they fixed on any other man\nit would have been nothing; but  his  perfect indifference, and  your \npointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!'	1.8706683766081462
'But\nI have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.'	1.8708331946557042
"Mr Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made\nno answer."	1.8711245973765516
'I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,  said Lady\nCatherine;  and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,\nif she does not practise a great deal.'	1.8712844087991813
'It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr Darcy himself; but,\nwhenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general\ncomplaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far\nremoved from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that\nthe improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however\ntemporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.'	1.871315643369402
'She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to\nher, cried in a half whisper,  I am glad you are come, for there is such\nfun here!--What do you think has happened this morning?--Mr Collins has\nmade an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.'	1.8716481719227018
'Well,  cried her mother,  it is all very right; who should do it but\nher own uncle?'	1.8717779266424186
'As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner\nin which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to\ngive them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other\ngot pretty near the truth.'	1.8718710480629968
'Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\ninsensibility.'	1.8719782490545565
'Mr Collins no sooner saw the two\ngirls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which\nCharlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked\nto dine at Rosings the next day.'	1.872234943238019
'I can readily believe,  answered he gravely,  that report may vary\ngreatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were\nnot to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to\nfear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.'	1.8722841739156995
'Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof\n     against the temptation of immediate relief.'	1.8727436088542213
'Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,  cried Colonel\nFitzwilliam.'	1.872978428880148
'Mr Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mr Philips, and\n she  ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her\nneighbours in Meryton.'	1.8731473770760947
'Mr Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked\nher, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.'	1.873155919146819
'Mr Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was\nrather offended; and therefore checked her laugh.'	1.8739522836286204
'Many of my acquaintance are\nalready there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest\nfriend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I\ndespair.'	1.874381753154844
'But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\nacknowledge?'	1.8744229613059413
'I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.'	1.8746111449525225
"She\nwould not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried\nhome; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think\nit at all advisable."	1.8747987148301415
'Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\ndisgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\nespecially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing\nat her sister and Bingley,) shall take place.'	1.874814507186699
'A great deal more passed at the\nother table.'	1.874905178502772
'The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to\n     say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are\n     discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.'	1.8751233259262137
'I must confess myself\n     surprised by your application; I did not expect it from  you .'	1.8754402392270242
'Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her\nladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.'	1.8756684945129372
'We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the\nmore anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that\nwhen there has been  one  intermarriage, she may have less trouble in\nachieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I\ndare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.'	1.875739982460902
'But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him,\nas to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?'	1.876256543923623
'The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,\nand who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he\ntold her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.'	1.8763768446505922
'As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile\nacross the park.--Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and\nElizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such\nraptures as Mr Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but\nslightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the\nhouse, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally\ncost Sir Lewis De Bourgh.'	1.8763810283142133
'I am particularly unlucky\nin meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a\npart of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree\nof credit.'	1.8764707805271852
'What you ask,  said Elizabeth,  is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr\nDarcy had much better finish his letter.'	1.876638001342759
'We are not on friendly terms,\nand it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\navoiding  him  but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of\nvery great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.'	1.8770944500032694
'Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained\nquietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned\ninto the drawing-room.'	1.8772609445648416
'Wherever you and Jane are known,\nyou must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less\nadvantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three very silly\nsisters.'	1.8776498889733853
'What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?'	1.8777936967558122
'Mr Gardiner would be prevented by business from\nsetting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again\nwithin a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so\nfar, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with\nthe leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up\nthe Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the\npresent plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire.'	1.8778139888124463
'Indeed,  replied Elizabeth,  I am heartily sorry for him; but he has\nother feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.'	1.8778893174683644
"E. GARDINER. \n\nMr Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal\nfrom the ----shire, as clearly as Mr Gardiner could do."	1.8782174314778057
"But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,\neven to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various\nconjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from\nthe difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable\nfrom the time of year."	1.8783170399170972
'The feelings\nof the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so\nwidely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant\ncircumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten.'	1.878718999468375
'Mr Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn\nwhen she was only eight years old.'	1.8790491921216197
'The rest of the evening brought her little amusement.'	1.8793658948149423
'I\nmust have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.'	1.8795410404061657
'I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when\nyour sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of\nthe ball.'	1.8796967759889096
'I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment\nof her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children,\nproduced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,\nwell-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was\nlucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in\nso unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and\ninvariably silly.'	1.8797379085548793
'He is not at all liked in\nHertfordshire.'	1.8797668152415852
'Mr Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great\npoliteness by the whole family.'	1.8799572609358015
"CHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage,\nand the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of\ntheir engagements at Rosings."	1.8802782083488456
'She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton\nscheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under\nfrequent discussion between her parents.'	1.8803068889253338
'But in spite of all this\n     fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that\n     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit\n     for  another interest  in the affair.'	1.8803406183562816
'I am only distressed by\nsome dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.'	1.880684594327576
'Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know\nwhat they were talking of.'	1.8808526313473222
'Yes, there was something in  that ; I told you so from the\nfirst, you may remember.'	1.881013129299436
'The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their\nrelationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore\nit; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he\ncould from such disgraceful companions.'	1.8812542409996884
"Mr Collins,\nseeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much\nas possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr Collins\ncould not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather\ndispleased by her staying at home."	1.881372780479758
'She anticipated what would be felt in\nthe family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one\nliked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a\n dislike  which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.'	1.8815210668973767
"My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light\nit places Mr Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a\nmanner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for.--It is\nimpossible."	1.8817574497454836
'On the contrary she was as much disposed to\ncomplain of it as her husband.--It was very strange that he should come\nto Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient\nand exceedingly troublesome.--She hated having visitors in the house\nwhile her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the\nmost disagreeable.'	1.8820484236188901
'Her mother\nimpatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady\nCatherine would not come in again and rest herself.'	1.8822056249808155
'He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to\nmake any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was\nstruck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to\nher,\n\n My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing?--Mr Darcy, you must allow\nme to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.--You\ncannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.'	1.8826817956218265
'It was consoling, that he should know she had\nsome relations for whom there was no need to blush.'	1.8827788101853318
'Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them\nmutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no\nreal confidence could ever subsist between them again.'	1.8828643744006126
'It was\nnecessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on\nsuch occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mr\nBennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.'	1.8835244422059767
'When my niece Georgiana went to\nRamsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men servants go\nwith her.--Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady\nAnne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--I\nam excessively attentive to all those things.'	1.8839150463010028
'Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not\nknow.'	1.8843199077471917
'It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.'	1.8844719611417382
'The suspicions which had just\narisen of Mr Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards\neach with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from\nthose enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what\nit was to love.'	1.884697565887133
'If I may so express it, he has a  right \nto be proud.'	1.8852189615017678
'I came to you without a\ndoubt of my reception.'	1.8852385111221526
'She had scarcely needed her\npresent observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that\ntheir elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather\nthan by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring\nfor her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain\nthat his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and\nif that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity\nof having a companion.'	1.8852999397151924
'Ignorant as you previously were of every thing\n     concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and\n     suspicion certainly not in your inclination.'	1.885490319735711
'She was\nto accompany Sir William and his second daughter.'	1.88557896280204
'MY DEAR HARRIET,\n\n      You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help\n     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am\n     missed.'	1.8859575076728028
'Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?--At\npresent I have not room to do them justice.'	1.8860168322954858
'But, perhaps his sister does as well\nfor the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he\nlikes with her.'	1.8864311870174306
'My good qualities are under your protection, and you are\nto exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me\nto find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may\nbe; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling\nto come to the point at last.'	1.8866428486380473
'As I did the other day,  said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile;  very\ntrue, it will be wise in me to refrain from  that .'	1.8866775326208254
"Her thoughts were instantly\ndriven back to the time when Mr Bingley's name had been last mentioned\nbetween them; and if she might judge from his complexion,  his  mind was\nnot very differently engaged."	1.8866958723049043
'Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied\nwith believing that  she  would have been his only choice, had fortune\npermitted it.'	1.886743112820823
'But the person who advanced, was now\nnear enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced\nher name.'	1.8868549598874051
'In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of\nthe carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,\n\n I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.'	1.8869948911090333
'I hope,  said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the\nnext day,  you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this\ndesirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;\nand if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after\nthe officers.--And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to\ncheck that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,\nwhich your lady possesses.'	1.8870481347726509
'But I must tell you how it went off.'	1.8871448162520934
'She turned from sister to sister, demanding their\ncongratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly\nround the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and\nobserved, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been\nthere.'	1.8871549797626932
'And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all,\nsince you went away.'	1.8875686450013396
"There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King."	1.8875968967421517
'He only meant that there were not\nsuch a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which\nyou must acknowledge to be true.'	1.887662019644573
"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in\n     her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have\n     been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me."	1.8878079085382677
'She wanted to hear of him, when there\nseemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.'	1.8878746476500745
'You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you\nare warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking\nopenly.'	1.888035056604998
"Lydia's being settled in the\nNorth, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her\ncompany, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in\nHertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a\npity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted\nwith every body, and had so many favourites."	1.8880692929499736
'While Sir William was with them, Mr Collins devoted his mornings\nto driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he\nwent away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and\nElizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin\nby the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and\ndinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading\nand writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which\nfronted the road.'	1.888583438919579
'But I can assure you,  she added,  that Lizzy does not lose much by not\nsuiting  his  fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at\nall worth pleasing.'	1.8888767578325405
'it\nhad been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.'	1.8888785675266062
'and turning round, he looked for a moment at\nElizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said,\n She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt  me ; and I am in no\nhumour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted\nby other men.'	1.888902785148989
'I was only confused for the moment, because I felt\nthat I  should  be looked at.'	1.889053407886933
"CHAPTER XIV.\n\n\nOne morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been\nformed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the\ndining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the\nsound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the\nlawn."	1.8892599671655466
'The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mr Forster,\nthe delight of Mr Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely\nto be described.'	1.8893722026860873
"Thursday was to be the wedding day,\nand on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose\nto take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and\nreluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her\nout of the room."	1.889382023512245
'You never will be able to make both\nof them good for any thing.'	1.8896018417665092
'But the fact is, that we are very\ndifferent sort of men, and that he hates me.'	1.8896189430828625
'If it was to be secret,  said Jane,  say not another word on the\nsubject.'	1.88967733732387
'She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were\nassembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of\nsurprise.--That she should have walked three miles so early in the day,\nin such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mr\nHurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her\nin contempt for it.'	1.8898825228952194
'At present I will not say more, but perhaps\nwhen we are better acquainted---- \n\nHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each\nother.'	1.8903627607382705
"The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering\nvisitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his\nwife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of\ndoing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady\nCatherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough."	1.8906652832942419
'All this was acknowledged to Mr Gardiner; and after relating the\ncircumstances, she thus went on:-- I am now convinced, my dear aunt,\nthat I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that\npure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,\nand wish him all manner of evil.'	1.8909056251382417
'It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the\nequipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.'	1.8912059502798024
'CHAPTER IV.\n\n\nElizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from\nJane, on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had\nbeen renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but\non the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the\nreceipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that\nit had been missent elsewhere.'	1.8914776440843015
'And rising as she thus\nspoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr Collins thus\naddressed her,\n\n When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I\nshall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given\nme; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I\nknow it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the\nfirst application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to\nencourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the\nfemale character.'	1.8916688965598583
'Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never\nbe over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt\nwere horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them.'	1.8920829770625476
'It\nwas not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.'	1.8921270124540384
'I shall write again as soon as any\n     thing more is determined on.'	1.892226858039042
"which will not be yours till after your mother's\ndecease, is all that you may ever be entitled to."	1.8922817134384307
'Mr Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.'	1.8924630232164554
'How much you\nmust have gone through!'	1.8925635813229431
'As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following\nmanner:--\n\n You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my\njourney hither.'	1.8925913068000393
'But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew.'	1.8926737785940282
"CHAPTER V.\n\n\nEvery object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to\nElizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had\nseen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,\nand the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight."	1.8935854078241394
"They were then,\nwith no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance,\ntaken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he\nwelcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble\nabode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment."	1.8936202257456498
'One of them does.'	1.894260067134568
'Of\nthis she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made\nhimself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough\nto dance with.'	1.8945659750728854
'Mr Hurst and her\nsister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and\nwere evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.'	1.8946871467084823
'After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr\nBennet coolly observed,\n\n From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two\nof the silliest girls in the country.'	1.8947671346277526
'Upon my word I say no more  here  than I might say in any house in the\nneighbourhood, except Netherfield.'	1.8948555782937602
'CHAPTER II.\n\n\nMr Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr Bingley.'	1.8949137665407507
'Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,\nand as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,\nwhich Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so\noccupied, she might have forgotten where she was.'	1.8949507808936874
'Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the\ncase?'	1.8950466851196803
"He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their\naunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was\nwell talked over.--To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged\nthat the necessity of his absence  had  been self imposed."	1.8952187292501712
'I comfort myself with thinking,  replied Jane,  that he certainly would\nnot marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her.'	1.8952631145843513
'Console Lady Catherine as well as\n     you can.'	1.895332471283561
"The first mentioned\n     was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached\n     Mr Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in\n     defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,\n     ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr\n     Wickham.--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of\n     my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who\n     had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who\n     had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,\n     to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could\n     be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--But\n     from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally\n     bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in\n     future secured, when the following account of my actions and their\n     motives has been read.--If, in the explanation of them which is\n     due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which\n     may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry.--The\n     necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--I\n     had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with\n     others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other\n     young woman in the country.--But it was not till the evening of the\n     dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a\n     serious attachment.--I had often seen him in love before.--At that\n     ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made\n     acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that\n     Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general\n     expectation of their marriage."	1.8954385444188893
'As to what\nrestraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a\ndishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know\nnothing of the effects that such a step might produce.'	1.8959774218150391
'I owe all that I know\nof it, to another, not to you.'	1.896051166377908
'About a month,  said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject\ndrop, added,  He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I\nunderstand.'	1.8960516149438957
"He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went\naway, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mr\nBennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband."	1.8960829219087008
'Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr\nCollins first came to Hunsford.'	1.8961856007791797
'Perhaps it would have been better;  replied her sister.'	1.8965710077725544
'Your sweetness\nand disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to\nyou.'	1.8967059139122822
'Sir William could not have\ninterrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for\nthemselves.--We have tried two or three subjects already without\nsuccess, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.'	1.8968826004013084
"CHAPTER VII.\n\n\nTwo days after Mr Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking\ntogether in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper\ncoming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their\nmother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,\nwhen they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet,  I beg your pardon,\nmadam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some\ngood news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask."	1.8970489188657091
"that  abominable Mr Darcy!--My father's opinion of me does\nme the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it."	1.897091963823342
'I think you said she was a widow, sir?'	1.8971181222820395
'I should have considered it as part of my duty, and\nthe exertion would soon have been nothing.'	1.8971989930508302
'He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.'	1.8978179001497228
"Mr\nBingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but\nsince he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt\nthe rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of\nboth gentlemen as I did before."	1.8978338267369717
'as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended\nthere was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if\nKitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we\nbehaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest\ncold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have\ntreated you too.'	1.8978969480951073
'Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what\nI learnt, to my own family!'	1.8981495952106542
"The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had\nbeen, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same\nkind of supposition, which had appeased Mr Bennet's curiosity; and\nElizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject."	1.8983247439322064
'Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to\nmarry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had\na wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found\nthem as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.'	1.8985603407881464
'Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I\nwas of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\nless certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\nany thing to deserve to lose it.'	1.8986675992970368
"Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but\nshe could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no\nlonger mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,\nit was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without\nmuch reluctance."	1.8987012992814745
'In a few days more, we\nmay gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married,\nand have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as\nlost.'	1.8987523422034316
'Nor was it under many, many minutes, that\nshe could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to\ncredit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the\nshape of a lover to any of them.'	1.8989580328765105
'Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him\nthat Mr Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as\nan impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it\nwas not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either\nside, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr Darcy, the superior in\nconsequence, to begin the acquaintance.--Mr Collins listened to her\nwith the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she\nceased speaking, replied thus,\n\n My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your\nexcellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your\nunderstanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference\nbetween the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those\nwhich regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider\nthe clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank\nin the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the\nsame time maintained.'	1.8992035235782136
"Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily\ndrawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mr Bennet's being quite\nunable to sit alone."	1.8992343227194506
'But you  will  know it, when I have told you what happened the very\nnext day.'	1.9001577556436735
'Well, and so just\nas the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business\nto that horrid man Mr Stone.'	1.90044736063398
'I would advise you merely to put on\nwhatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion\nfor any thing more.'	1.9007019953866582
'Very true, indeed;--and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in\nbehalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the\nbusiness?--Do clear  them  too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of\nsomebody.'	1.900877799933706
'She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till\nthey were joined by Mr Collins, who entered with an air more stately\nthan usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,\n\n Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and\nlet Mr Collins and me have a little conversation together.'	1.900893281773977
'Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.'	1.9010379017190067
'Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my\nlife, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see\nuncommonly pretty.'	1.9022238414057173
'Such a\nchange in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but\ngratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such\nits impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means\nunpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.'	1.9027543377161862
'It was next to impossible that their cousin should\ncome in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had\nreceived pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.'	1.9027711388955573
'She immediately felt\nthat whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,\nmust be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was\nsatisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made\nhim think really ill of her.'	1.902974613072197
'It is settled between us already, that\nwe are to be the happiest couple in the world.'	1.903022116189039
'At length however Mr Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who\nhad been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no\nlikelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.'	1.9031875143771821
"Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting, that had\nshe chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her\nfuture niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her\nladyship's indignation would have been."	1.9036847886124693
'Then, the two third he danced with Miss\nKing, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane\nagain, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger---- \n\n If he had had any compassion for  me ,  cried her husband impatiently,\n he would not have danced half so much!'	1.9037576621695294
'How abominable!--I wonder that the very\npride of this Mr Darcy has not made him just to you!--If from no better\nmotive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for\ndishonesty I must call it.'	1.9039224132215016
'After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with\n\n It is  your  turn to say something now, Mr Darcy.-- I  talked about\nthe dance, and  you  ought to make some kind of remark on the size of\nthe room, or the number of couples.'	1.9040791698798325
'That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other\ninducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny.'	1.9041057433310313
'It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we\ncannot escape the acquaintance now.'	1.904154968681044
'Elizabeth did all she could, to shield\nhim from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him\nto herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse\nwithout mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising\nfrom all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it\nadded to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to\nthe time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to\neither, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at\nPemberley.'	1.9041565293005727
'You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but\nwhich I have never acknowledged.'	1.9044006393474124
'The idea of Mr Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away\nwith by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not\nuse the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and\nhe continued:'	1.9045450823986916
'I do not remember her name among the ladies at\ncourt.'	1.904618863829047
'His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr Collins was walking\nthe whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,\nin order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow\nas the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great\nintelligence.'	1.9047165445589622
"They could\nnot be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character\nfrom their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference\nto any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known,\nwould not have recognised it for Mr Darcy."	1.9047222778644353
'The general prejudice against Mr Darcy is so violent,\nthat it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to\nattempt to place him in an amiable light.'	1.9047934781101026
'Could I expect it to be otherwise!'	1.9048703709504107
'This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of\nMr Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,\ntherefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent\nmatters till they reached the parsonage.'	1.905468770036032
'It would look odd to be\nentirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of\n some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the\ntrouble of saying as little as possible.'	1.9055111083494056
"Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on\nMr Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she\ncalled at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,\nthough Mr Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been\nenough to drive happiness away."	1.9055581375127533
'I thank you\nagain and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but\nto accept them is absolutely impossible.'	1.905840513385395
'CHAPTER XV.\n\n\nThe discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw\nElizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many\nhours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.'	1.9059229954604648
"Elizabeth, for the sake of\nsaying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if\nCharlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since  her  coming away."	1.9067191018085634
"Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare\nthat Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she\nis perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she\nsuspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to\nput me on my guard?"	1.9068011789702148
'Miss Darcy looked as if she\nwished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\nshort sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.'	1.9068092399088972
'In the absence of Jane,\nhe always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of\nher; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of\nrelief.'	1.9069844158594393
'To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and\nwhose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\ninformation, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted\nfor the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an\ninterest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as\nwhat Jane felt for Bingley.'	1.9070472827024765
'I have no right to give  my  opinion,  said Wickham,  as to his being\nagreeable or otherwise.'	1.9071486538824662
'From what she had said of her resolution to\nprevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate\nan application to her nephew; and how  he  might take a similar\nrepresentation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared\nnot pronounce.'	1.9071898684603712
'Elizabeth, construing all\nthis into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on\nthis account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors\nleft them, capable of considering the last half hour with some\nsatisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been\nlittle.'	1.907322572908952
'It was more\nthan civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such\nattention.'	1.9073669059210265
'I have just had a letter from\nJane, with such dreadful news.'	1.9074152463957503
'What do you mean, Hill?'	1.9076359429754217
"The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most\nremarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself\nagreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than\nin Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence."	1.9076971252652564
'Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of\nspirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that\nshe did not like to go home again so soon, she added,\n\n But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you\nmay stay a little longer.'	1.9083377892570748
"Now was the\nmoment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was\nhigh, she immediately said,\n\n Mr Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving\nrelief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your's."	1.9085312107203207
'My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I\nconfess that I did not expect to receive  more  than my due.'	1.9086541100228358
"Had Miss Bingley known what\npain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have\nrefrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\nElizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed\nher partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in\nDarcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and\nabsurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that\ncorps."	1.9089807714916889
'Howsoever that may be, you\n     are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined\n     by Mr Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter,\n     to whom I have related the affair.'	1.9090575506124128
'Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real\noccasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to\noppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her\ntongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it\nbetter that  one  only of the household, and the one whom they could\nmost trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the\nsubject.'	1.9093695988932906
'Mr Collins was carefully instructing them in\nwhat they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many\nservants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.'	1.9098185320897654
'From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my\nacquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest\nbelief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the\nfeelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of\ndisapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a\ndislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the\nlast man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.'	1.9098767001174193
'But if you are really innocent and\n     ignorant, I must be more explicit.'	1.909926239367596
'This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I\nflatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.'	1.9100905067511282
'Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know.'	1.9102026498587792
"Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had\nno sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former\nacquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an\nintercourse renewed after many years discontinuance."	1.9102588490911885
'I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared\n     something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock\n     is over, shall I own that I long for your return?'	1.9103459516454617
'After sitting long enough to admire every\narticle of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to\ngive an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London,\nMr Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large\nand well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.'	1.9106509579360031
'You know I always\nspeak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling\npost by themselves.'	1.9107471020306084
'But his pride, his abominable pride, his\nshameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his\nunpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it,\nand the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr Wickham, his\ncruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the\npity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.'	1.9111978267797582
'Colonel Fitzwilliam had called\nat the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr Darcy they had\nonly seen at church.'	1.9113010047068202
'It was not to be supposed that any other\npeople could be meant than those with whom she was connected.'	1.9114138736496145
"In as short a time as Mr Collins's long speeches would allow, every\nthing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they\nentered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was\nto make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be\nwaved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his\nhappiness."	1.9115642081043789
'That had\nhis actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of\nevery thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and\nthat friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man\nas Mr Bingley, was incomprehensible.'	1.9123296540298405
'Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their\nconversation, which had been passing while Mr and Mr Gardiner were\nengaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of\nthe whole party.'	1.9123427133121644
'I did not wink at you.'	1.9123589780960686
'She is a great\nreader and has no pleasure in anything else.'	1.9124269529495856
'But it\nwas her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;\nand all was soon right again.'	1.9125996695283278
'I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.'	1.9126319104001288
'Jane,  cried Elizabeth,  was there a servant belonging to it, who\ndid not know the whole story before the end of the day?'	1.913438257296877
'As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass\nbetween the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or\nboth, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such\nbehaviour than her sister.'	1.9135210668417426
'Do not you want to know who has taken it?'	1.913608552225546
'This he considered sufficient encouragement,\nand the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her,\nimmediately followed.'	1.913812194803626
'Jane was anxious that no\ndifference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded\nthat she talked as much as ever.'	1.9141189531683473
"There could be no conversation in the noise of\nMr Philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every\nbody."	1.9142924587371528
'Kitty and me were to spend\nthe day there, and Mr Forster promised to have a little dance in the\nevening; (by the bye, Mr Forster and me are  such  friends!) and so\nshe asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen\nwas forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?'	1.9144045487189594
'To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of\nconversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the\nhappiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm\nhouse.'	1.9144826284621463
'Mr Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while\nSir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings\nfound a rapid vent.'	1.914655762300271
'But I am very\nfar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.'	1.9147241302957587
'Mary,  said she,  I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!'	1.9149406043046042

'His circumstances, he\n     assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were\n     exceedingly bad.'	1.915134949012763
'She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far\nas they concerned George Wickham.'	1.9152398871753773
'My dear aunt, how could you think of it?'	1.915594239168409
'I thought I should have died.'	1.915971374151966
'Can it be\npossible that he will marry her?'	1.9160129136254676
'The apothecary came, and having\nexamined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a\nviolent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;\nadvised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.'	1.9163324067407113
"But\nher commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means\nsatisfy Mr Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's\npraise into his own hands."	1.91712367611122
'I advise Mr Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,  said Mr Bennet,  to walk\nto Oakham Mount this morning.'	1.917496117425765
'Could she have seen half as much love in Mr Darcy\nfor herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.'	1.9180663127200241
'I do not believe she often sees such at home.'	1.9181483256503258
'The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are\non their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.'	1.9185761868761717
'dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain.'	1.9186227760427406
'His revenge would have been complete indeed.'	1.9190062578692308
'Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did\nMr Bennet give up the point.'	1.9190164009688198
"Mr Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his\nfather's life time."	1.9190294388762696
'He could not help\nseeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in\nthe room.'	1.9192804813905915
'Her air\nwas not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to\nmake her visitors forget their inferior rank.'	1.9192941508079349
"Mr Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\npleasure to Mr Bennet."	1.919787944983809
'Mr Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine\nthere, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did\nnot think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a\nman, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and\npride of one who had ten thousand a-year.'	1.9208142515461348
'I had not\nbelieved it possible.'	1.9209388076836726
'One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two\nelder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,\n\n Lizzy, I never gave  you  an account of my wedding, I believe.'	1.920953180782707
'It\nseems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,  said she.'	1.9210665322235623
'And even when it\nwas settled that Lydia should go with Mr Forster, the necessity of\nopening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.'	1.9212221352403451
'I am confident that she would have performed\ndelightfully.'	1.9215024208192544
'My dear Jane, Mr Collins is\na conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well\nas I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries\nhim, cannot have a proper way of thinking.'	1.9220013769698023
'Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be\nnear so much like a ball.'	1.922115949666207
'To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had\nbeen asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his\nrepeating it.'	1.9221893521704783
'But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom\nthey had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking\nwith an officer on the other side of the way.'	1.9222670941113171
'She was afraid of talking longer of his\nfriend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the\ntrouble of finding a subject to him.'	1.9225773027500357
'I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I\nmay perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion  of  him, and  to  him, too\nfreely.'	1.922730402430839
"In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely\nawed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage\nenough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;\nand his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge\nof her chair, not knowing which way to look."	1.9228271909975263
'The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will\nprove what she felt.'	1.9230408242384172
'He is certainly a good brother,  said Elizabeth, as she walked towards\none of the windows.'	1.923434040368321
'The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them\npronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.'	1.9237534791347068
'But above all, above respect and esteem,\nthere was a motive within her of good will which could not be\noverlooked.'	1.9238492009660237
'His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but\nthough he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no\nmeans unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mr Hurst, who had\nmarried a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider\nhis house as her home when it suited her.'	1.9238736660053437
'When first Mr Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly\nuseless; for, of course, they were to have a son.'	1.9242531244280732
'He is just what a young man ought to be,  said she,  sensible, good\nhumoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease,\nwith such perfect good breeding!'	1.92450811902409
'This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and\nshe could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the\nacquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had\nrevolted, in his offer to herself.'	1.9247967746977834
'When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,\n\n Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.'	1.9248236944135104
'Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he\ncould not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at\nbeing spoke to.'	1.9248690085799849
'Her resistance had not\ninjured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some\ncomplacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,\n\n I can guess the subject of your reverie.'	1.9250017002218398
'Very few days passed in which Mr Collins did not walk to Rosings, and\nnot many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;\nand till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings\nto be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many\nhours.'	1.9250909928986728
"But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon\nyounger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and\namusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to\nmarry early.--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of\nyouth, as the first."	1.9251124547962915
'That is right.--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you\nwill not take comfort in mine.'	1.9253146202103868
"The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her\nstory, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a\nreproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon\nregained her composure, and calmly replied,\n\n Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible\nthat Mr Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,\nbecause he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"	1.9254309656704858
'Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier\ngirls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him,\nthere had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted\nwith all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel\nmore beautiful.'	1.9254801825612315
'And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and\nadmire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.'	1.925567075945605
"CHAPTER XVI.\n\n\nAs no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their\naunt, and all Mr Collins's scruples of leaving Mr and Mr Bennet for\na single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach\nconveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the\ngirls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,\nthat Mr Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in\nthe house."	1.926155682529686
'You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr Bingley,  she added,  for when\nyou went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with\nus, as soon as you returned.'	1.9262392513374436
'I have therefore made up my mind to tell\nyou, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if\nyou dare.'	1.926392538895355
'If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the\nneighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we\nmight possibly get a settled family there.'	1.9265001800551487
"My dear sir,  replied Mr Collins,  I am particularly obliged to you\nfor this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so\nmaterial a step without her ladyship's concurrence."	1.9272769427339629
'I knew it to be a\nmost respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me\nfarther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great\nattentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.'	1.927412713636314
'are quite well.'	1.927733093637954
'and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would\nbe accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of\ninferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to\nthe family!'	1.9279361070684384
'They had been walking about the\nplace with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn\nto dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a\ncarriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a\ncurricle, driving up the street.'	1.9280324266323365
'Mr Bennet was not in the\nhabit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five\nset off together.'	1.9281230026833944
"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if\npossible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,\nwhether Wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to\nknow in what part of the town he has now concealed himself."	1.9283216451131382
'When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth\nfor the indulgence of some music.'	1.9286518533906756
'He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by\nbeing impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.'	1.9286630279345163
"The motive professed, was his conviction of its being\n     owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well\n     known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,\n     to love or confide in him."	1.9288341888594367
'It was absolutely\nnecessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence\nrecollecting  when  she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling\ncurious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty\ndeparture, she observed,\n\n How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr Darcy!'	1.9289473680708442
'If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,\n he  was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that\nJane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.'	1.9297126609461108
'Mr and Mr Collins have a comfortable income, but not\nsuch a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my\nfriend would not call herself  near  her family under less than  half \nthe present distance.'	1.9297571828029274
'If they believed him attached to me, they would not try\nto part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.'	1.9303547598662991
'There he had talked to her\nfriends, when he could not to herself.'	1.9305901872964977
'indeed, nobody\ncan, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\ndown the dance.'	1.9309562514851222
'Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a\ngreat opposition of character.--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the\neasiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could\noffer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never\nappeared dissatisfied.'	1.9310071501217094
'It is\nwonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that\nway.'	1.931159293393561
"Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady\nCatherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a\nmoment's deliberation,\n\n I am not."	1.9312499006044168
'Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a\nprivate conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.'	1.9313512308194376
"She enquired into Charlotte's domestic\nconcerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice,\nas to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be\nregulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the\ncare of her cows and her poultry."	1.931485753902364
"Five daughters\nsuccessively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mr\nBennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he\nwould."	1.9315417458796638
'Nobody can tell what I\nsuffer!--But it is always so.'	1.932383638534978
'But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr\nBingley, if he  had been  imposed on, would have much to suffer when the\naffair became public.'	1.9325123980708856
'That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,  cried her\nbrother-- because he does  not  write with ease.'	1.9328913061220605
'She\ncould not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,\nwrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\nLydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been\nintended.'	1.9333401857826629
'The first wish of my heart,  said she to herself,  is never more to be\nin company with either of them.'	1.9333683051082806
'I cannot think of it without abhorrence.'	1.9336901316005568
'She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in\ndisposition and talents, would most suit her.'	1.9340894396187112
'When Mr Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual\nphilosophic composure.'	1.9344372622290755
'Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in\n     London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they\n     would have taken up their abode with her.'	1.9344482843889355
'my dear,  continued Mr Bennet,  I am quite delighted with him.'	1.9346326851613997
"The strangeness of Mr Collins's making two offers\nof marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being\nnow accepted."	1.9347683503129816
'I have just as much\nright to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.'	1.9348802265090923
'I have been meditating on the very great pleasure\nwhich a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.'	1.935067734968555
'She resolved to give her the information herself, and\ntherefore charged Mr Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner,\nto drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.'	1.9356531918890416
'Elizabeth\nwas ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated\nbetween Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in\nlistening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all\ndinner time.'	1.9360882546185718
'On the evening before my going to London,  said he  I made a confession\nto him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.'	1.9362080047308787
'Mr Bingley had not been of\nage two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to\nlook at Netherfield House.'	1.9366220512631969
'You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy\nwere sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr Darcy.'	1.9369253082662348
'He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say\nthat he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I\nparticularly begged him to do.'	1.9373602674445678
'His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;\nand the kind of half-expectation which Mr Gardiner had formed, of\ntheir being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.'	1.9379790727753514
'I should never have considered the distance as one of the  advantages \nof the match,  cried Elizabeth.'	1.9380708720923037
'CHAPTER IX.\n\n\nElizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,\nwhile Mr Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,\nwhen she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a\nvisitor.'	1.9381401951817574
'You  are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,  said Mr\nDarcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.'	1.9382975424307567
'What\n     he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress\n     will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest\n     way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again\n     to-morrow evening.'	1.9383228581067102
'She saw that he wanted to engage her on\nthe old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge\nhim.'	1.938348303414998
'Yes, very well.'	1.9393396454423626
'They are young in the ways\nof the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that\nhandsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the\nplain.'	1.93941094799172
'This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but\nMr Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,\n\n You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may\nprove so; for else they will be destitute enough.'	1.9396326222437632
'I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for\nPurvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.'	1.9399640150616257
'But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been\n     acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her\n     brother is the cause of it.'	1.9402356324903147
'Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to\nacknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it.'	1.940586116875603
'She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that\nLydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had\nwanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body.'	1.9408976835330018
'I knew,  said he,  that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was\nnecessary.'	1.9411370195065025
'This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted\nonly regimentals to make him completely charming.'	1.9412639452588545
'It was reasonable that he should feel\nhe had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising\nit; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,\nshe could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might\nassist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be\nmaterially concerned.'	1.9412746386921726
'I am not qualified to form one.'	1.941453240771718
'Elizabeth, you are not serious now.'	1.941657450836523
'Can you deny that you have done it?'	1.941740074087376
'You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.'	1.9424339705978586
'I never heard of her existence till the day before\nyesterday.'	1.9425282723419148
'But no\nsooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had\nhardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\nuncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.'	1.9427885271433023
'While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether\nshe most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr Darcy, by the\nfeelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but\na moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to\nregret that he came.'	1.943294928266259
'This Mr\n     Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he\n     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town.'	1.943735618776252
'Perhaps he had been civil, only because he\nfelt himself at ease; yet there had been  that  in his voice, which was\nnot like ease.'	1.9439314780626564
'As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from\nexciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she\nconsidered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense\nfor the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it\nknown, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her\ngo.'	1.9439508964179804
'He bore with philosophy the conviction that\nElizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude\nand falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every\nthing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on\nto make his fortune.'	1.9439904993701282
'I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her\ncharming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most\nelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by\nher.--These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and\nit is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to\npay.'	1.944064728860376
"In a few days Mr Bingley returned Mr Bennet's visit, and sat about ten\nminutes with him in his library."	1.9443829273085684
'I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and\ncould say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing\nforward and precipitate.'	1.9443910535684203
"In no countenance was attentive\ncuriosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the\nsmiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\nobjects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\nto Mr Darcy were by no means over."	1.944491584098229
'But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object.'	1.9447596597921464
'If I,  said Mr Collins,  were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I\nshould have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an\nair; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly\ncompatible with the profession of a clergyman.--I do not mean however to\nassert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to\nmusic, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.'	1.9448534000350814
'Charlotte the wife of Mr Collins,\nwas a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing\nherself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction\nthat it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot\nshe had chosen.'	1.9449456829312477
'It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not\nvisit them.'	1.9451383378261757
"On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,\nwhose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to\nwait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her\nfor a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower."	1.9452812448157428
'She received him with\nher very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,\napologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with\nher, which he could not help flattering himself however might be\njustified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to\nher notice.'	1.9455387297408793
'But I am\nafraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means\nintend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a\ncircumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I\ncould.'	1.9455788290072098
'His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr Darcy, was one of the best men\nthat ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be\nin company with this Mr Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\nthousand tender recollections.'	1.9459580271710037
'Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.'	1.9461975484392906
'And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that\nwould not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.'	1.9463471230992473
'Yes, I have had a letter from him by express.'	1.946647148431392
'He has made me so happy,  said she, one evening,  by telling me, that\nhe was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!'	1.9468428432935168
'The tumult of her mind was now painfully great.'	1.9469436643173779
"I want to be told whether I\nought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand\nWickham's character."	1.9470850935097026
'In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there\nwith Mr Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in\nLondon.'	1.9479274550100703
'Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr Bingley had been a most delightful\nfriend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked\nherself.'	1.948070556033277
'You must not be too severe upon yourself,  replied Elizabeth.'	1.9487804920392238
'Well, my comfort is, I am sure\nJane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he\nhas done.'	1.9494191697693324
'I dare say I shall\nsoon see them here.'	1.9496119058790256
'Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many\npeople he knew, but  he  had never seen any thing but affability in her.'	1.9498739705914374
'It is impossible for  me  to\nbe impartial.'	1.949939825811757
'Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\nall.'	1.9503384302996511
"Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had\nsomething to say to him before he had advanced many steps."	1.9505965217036556
'Jane resolutely\nkept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went\nto the window--she looked,--she saw Mr Darcy with him, and sat down\nagain by her sister.'	1.9508626826483737
'An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr\nGardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing\nremained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of\nthe morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could\nhave supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.'	1.9517542772150733
'Her younger\nsisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness\nwhich she might in future be able to dispense.'	1.9521040450768636
'He\n was  coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had\nany idea of their not being gone to Scotland:'	1.952199000079584
'my dear father, can you\nsuppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever\nthey are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the\ndisgrace?'	1.9522090197043864
'Mr Hurst and Mr Bingley were at piquet, and\nMr Hurst was observing their game.'	1.952414295674781
"Elizabeth, though she did not credit above\nhalf of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of\nher sister's ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still\nless of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now\ncome, when if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before\nentirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some\nnews of them."	1.9527852636672378
"Unwilling as she\nwas to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so\ndishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its\nfrequently recurring."	1.9528245928551593
'She did not choose it,  said her daughter,  she would go.'	1.9528260744240882
'I have been a disappointed man, and\nmy spirits will not bear solitude.'	1.9529721316901483
'At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and\nthe others returned into the house.'	1.9532706864270284
'I know of nobody that is coming I am sure,\nunless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope  my  dinners\nare good enough for her.'	1.9534118066471018
'I now give it to  you , if you are resolved on\nhaving him.'	1.9536101844987568
'The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this\nconversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom\nthey had been speaking; Mr Bingley and his sisters came to give their\npersonal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was\nfixed for the following Tuesday.'	1.953658257013098
'But you see that Jane,  said her aunt,  does not think so ill of\nWickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.'	1.9544947783252755
'It is a long time, Mr Bingley, since you went away,  said Mr Bennet.'	1.9550828623193197
"said Lydia stoutly,  I am not afraid; for though I  am  the\nyoungest, I'm the tallest."	1.9551390031925562
'On finding\nMr Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon\nafter breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,\n\n May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,\nwhen I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the\ncourse of this morning?'	1.955280523651197
"Mr Wickham's happiness and her own was per force\ndelayed a little longer, and Mr Collins's proposal accepted with as\ngood a grace as she could."	1.9555127553391267
'I happened to overhear the\ngentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of\nthis house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother\nLady Catherine.'	1.95595233335462
'A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side\ncalm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte\nand her sister, just returned from their walk.'	1.9561626666951117
'The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great\nfor her to know in what manner she acceded to it.'	1.9567483584347625
'He concluded with\nrepresenting to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of\nall his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with\nexpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of\nhis hand.'	1.957182919616002
'Something very much to the purpose of course.'	1.957228854579645
'It was many months since she had mentioned his name to\nElizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,\n\n I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present\nreport; and I know I appeared distressed.'	1.9578355518097763
'He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London.'	1.9579128996077135
"Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the\nmelancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there\nhimself."	1.957977951856791
'You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr Collins, for she vows she will\nnot have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and\nnot have  her .'	1.958086548655434
'I can remember no symptom of affection on either\nside; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware\nthat ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away.'	1.958473965001784
'Conceal the unhappy truth as\nlong as it is possible.--I know it cannot be long.'	1.9587977079443615
"Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her\nhusband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her\nneighbours might all see Mr Bingley in consequence of it, before  they \ndid."	1.9588930009216958
'They repulsed\nevery attempt of Mr Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a\nlanguor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the\nlong speeches of Mr Collins, who was complimenting Mr Bingley and his\nsisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and\npoliteness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.'	1.9593099325437695
"Well, any friend of\nMr Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else I must\nsay that I hate the very sight of him."	1.9596611183667996
'I had not an idea of it.'	1.959885479937991
'But I am at his disposal.'	1.9599698636720293
'There can be no doubt of that.'	1.959970794027068
'After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.'	1.9606152917563706
'Elizabeth was watchful enough to\nsee it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.'	1.960879086684555
"Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last\nvery rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,\nafter assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to\nsee her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most\ntenderly, she even shook hands with the former.--Elizabeth took leave of\nthe whole party in the liveliest spirits."	1.9610291893336202
'She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but\nshe could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and\ncold was their manner, whenever they did.'	1.9610901620915282
'She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in\na voice which proved it to be Mr Darcy, she moved again towards the\ngate.'	1.9612294125303336
'We must not make him desperate.'	1.9614082414410163
'At length, however, the question was\nasked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mr Reynolds\nreplied, that he was, adding,  but we expect him to-morrow, with a\nlarge party of friends.'	1.9615526502787806
'This was one point, with\nregard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr Bennet\ncould have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.'	1.9617169949024662
'She is so fond of Mr Forster,  said she,  it will be quite shocking\nto send her away!'	1.961874359755367
'Mr Darcy is\nengaged to  my daughter .'	1.9619955337588642
'Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what\nshe did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely\nthe effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw\nher no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at\nthe time, she had the same story to repeat every day.'	1.962083397723112
'Lizzy, to\nknow that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear\nfamily!'	1.9625241092563361
"It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he\nhad pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended\nhim still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in\nbeing with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her\nformer favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw\nthere was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,\nshe believed he might have the best informed mind."	1.962565449034018
'Her tour to the Lakes\nwas now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation\nfor all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her\nmother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in\nthe scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.'	1.9626055479564004
"I know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a\npatched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles."	1.9628398972551853
'My feelings will not be\nrepressed.'	1.9632840208033613
'This observation would not have prevented her\nfrom trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an\ninconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity\nof saying much.'	1.963756582676882
'As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned\nher attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr Bingley, and the\ntrain of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,\nmade her perhaps almost as happy as Jane.'	1.9637907029393376
'I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with\n     who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the\n     world I love, and he is an angel.'	1.963827409145712
'The farewell between herself and Mr Wickham was perfectly friendly; on\nhis side even more.'	1.9638622867328361
'Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was\nobliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility\nand truth in a few short sentences.'	1.9643827774450415
'By all that I have\never read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human\nnature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us\nwho do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some\nquality or other, real or imaginary.'	1.964813408472994
'You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?'	1.9649003823742965
'yes,  said Elizabeth drily-- Mr Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr\nBingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.'	1.9650098773013824
'But,\nmy dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley\ntells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\ndegree less sensible of  your  merit than when he took leave of you on\nTuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of\nbeing in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.'	1.9652048802678979
'She got up, and ran out of the room;\nand returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to\nthe dining-parlour.'	1.9652824683685137
'And with a bow to Mr Darcy, he concluded his speech,\nwhich had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--Many\nstared.--Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr Bennet\nhimself, while his wife seriously commended Mr Collins for having\nspoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that\nhe was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.'	1.965573632743912
'But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little\nsoftened by his manner of expressing himself.'	1.9656829563323361
'The principal\npurport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr Wickham had resolved\non quitting the Militia.'	1.9658705973830939
'His regiment is there; for I suppose you\nhave heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the\nregulars.'	1.9658847539764819
'I hardly know how Mr Collins was first introduced to her\nnotice, but he certainly has not known her long.'	1.9662513034084783
'I assure you, Madam,  he replied,  that she does not need such advice.'	1.9666463580524296
'There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he\nis disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to\ndiscourage him.'	1.9670193316348985
'But as it is--you\nmust not let your fancy run away with you.'	1.9671313153528416
'--said Jane faintly smiling,-- You must know that\nthough I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could\nnot hesitate.'	1.9673562547650907
'I assure\nyou that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with\nmyself, I should not pay him half so much deference.'	1.9678728010566156
'He has been so unlucky as to lose  your  friendship,  replied Elizabeth\nwith emphasis,  and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all\nhis life.'	1.9679002808780224
'But with  me , it is not so.'	1.968095707596963
"There is but one part of my conduct in the\n     whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is\n     that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to\n     conceal from him your sister's being in town."	1.969851101026165
'I wish you had been there, my\ndear, to have given him one of your set downs.'	1.9706670638773756
'I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly\ndid.'	1.971035791344588
'Mr Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to\nsupper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the\nothers, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.'	1.9711114053023635
'By tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr Bennet was glad to\ntake his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad\nto invite him to read aloud to the ladies.'	1.9715762050513446
'But as to your\nother objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.'	1.9716160701560475
'He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family,\nand looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever\ndone.'	1.971629381129841
'When those dances\nwere over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with\nher, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr Darcy, who took\nher so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without\nknowing what she did, she accepted him.'	1.9716429410591279
'I have not a doubt of your\ndoing very well together.'	1.9717539331099074
"Kitty then owned, with a very natural\ntriumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last\nletter, she had prepared her for such a step."	1.9721651070447872
'Her ladyship seemed pleased\nwith the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to\noffer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to\nladies.'	1.9723671026584417
"They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mr Bennet, in\nthe meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good\nhumour, and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had\nrevived."	1.9725617150034849
'Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would\n     write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.'	1.9726423289152348
'Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr and Mr Gardiner did, a question\nwhich she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.'	1.9726519055127836
"To Caroline's\nassertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no\ncredit."	1.9734177285739816
"CHAPTER IX.\n\n\nTheir sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her\nprobably more than she felt for herself."	1.973553276867734
'She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and\nturned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly\nsurmount even in speaking to Mr Bingley, whose blind partiality\nprovoked her.'	1.9740808168913073
"In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help\nfeeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting\nin this interference."	1.974302146159843
"Mr Darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart."	1.9743943030672733
'He had to be sure done much.'	1.974403806285313
'She had been graciously pleased to\napprove of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of\npreaching before her.'	1.9744425533369747
'And even Mary could assure her family\nthat she had no disinclination for it.'	1.9749469653499503
'Yes, very different.'	1.975121928244731
'She wanted to ascertain the\nfeelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to\nmake herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she\nfeared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she\nendeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.'	1.9756483582314233
'Mr Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment\nof her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family\ndinner.'	1.9760218063754305
'When they sat down to\nsupper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which\nplaced them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find\nthat her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,\nopenly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be\nsoon married to Mr Bingley.--It was an animating subject, and Mr\nBennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of\nthe match.'	1.9760857776637386
'But\nLizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.'	1.976169220444928
'That he is\nas false and deceitful, as he is insinuating.'	1.976598608396848
'At last she recollected that\nshe had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with\ngreat perseverance.'	1.9768285934190255
'Well, my dear,  said he, when she ceased speaking,  I have no more to\nsay.'	1.9768685885834527
"Wickham, perhaps,\nis my favourite; but I think I shall like  your  husband quite as well\nas Jane's."	1.9771619058003762
'Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but\ntheir visit to Rosings.'	1.977187809981544
'It\nwas an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease\nand liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved,\nand from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must\nhave received benefit of greater importance.'	1.977363637547707
'But she is too much like her brother,--very,\nvery proud.--As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and\nextremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her\namusement.'	1.977409769833309
'That he should even speak to\nher was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her\nfamily!'	1.9774957072805242
'But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr Bingley when he comes into\nthe neighbourhood.'	1.9782464753511715
'This information, however, startled Mr Bennet;--she would have been\nglad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage\nhim by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe\nit, and could not help saying so.'	1.9783189330923239
"Remember that she is one of a\nlarge family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be\nready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something\nlike regard and esteem for our cousin."	1.9787950274597288
"I was not in a humour to\nwait for any opening of your's."	1.978848486671136
'Next time you call,  said she,  I hope we shall be more lucky.'	1.9788666739325798
'He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing\nwith her himself, attended to her conversation with others.'	1.9788839542741001
"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,\nand pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful\nlittle design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss\nGrantley's."	1.9791672970882837
'She shared in their attendance on Mr Bennet, and was a\ngreat comfort to them, in their hours of freedom.'	1.9792264854497799
'At such a moment, the arrival of her friend\nwas a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their\nmeetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she\nsaw Mr Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her\nhusband.'	1.9792416101742205
'Take your choice, but you must be satisfied\nwith only one.'	1.9793047046792864
'Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.'	1.9793369937460614
'Those to her mother, contained little else, than that\nthey were just returned from the library, where such and such officers\nhad attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as\nmade her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which\nshe would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a\nviolent hurry, as Mr Forster called her, and they were going to the\ncamp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less\nto be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much\ntoo full of lines under the words to be made public.'	1.979419113211715
'you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.'	1.9797808724521888
'I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much\nfor me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle.'	1.9800963938092797
'This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure, \nsaid he.'	1.9807635742111975
'Mr Bennet replied that he had not.'	1.9807684278532087
'He had not\na temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of\npreference which was often given me.'	1.9813046083037895
'My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so\nmuch?'	1.9814464458019048
'The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a\nmanoeuvre of Mr Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of\nan hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how\nheartily they were wished away by some of the family.'	1.9814938732927367
'When at length they arose to take leave, Mr Bennet was most pressingly\ncivil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and\naddressed herself particularly to Mr Bingley, to assure him how happy\nhe would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,\nwithout the ceremony of a formal invitation.'	1.982290106943514
"The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter\nof an hour's tête-à-tête with Mr Bennet before breakfast, a\nconversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally\nto the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at\nLongbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general\nencouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.-- As to\nher  younger  daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could\nnot positively answer--but she did not  know  of any prepossession;--her\n eldest  daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her\nto hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."	1.9823366554256763
'I have been a\nselfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.'	1.9825290064326755
'That is a question which Mr Darcy only can answer.'	1.9826873684391957
'And what is your success?'	1.9828997164076319
'Louisa and I were agreeing that we\nshould not have known her again.'	1.9831704141931328
'You know not what you are\nabout.'	1.9839357563891453
'You have only proved by this,  cried Elizabeth,  that Mr Bingley did\nnot do justice to his own disposition.'	1.9839841527357038
'Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not\nwait on him.'	1.9841092934397175
'In a short time, I shall have a daughter married.'	1.9841674225827708
'Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.'	1.984211182627898
'He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard\nthem from Mr Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to\nhim  conditionally  only.'	1.9844505448575063
'In that\ncounty, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three\nweeks; and to Mr Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.'	1.9847398107843524
'It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that\nthey were under obligations to a person who could never receive a\nreturn.'	1.9850318018291038
'This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree.'	1.9850649896920258
'Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,\nand nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during\nthese visits.'	1.9854471628351973
"Mr Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such\nas he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for\nit gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had\nbeen used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and\nmore foolish than his daughter!"	1.9858801826440797
'She had known, it seems,\nof their being in love with each other, many weeks.'	1.9865944128912516
'His marriage was\nnow fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think\nit inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that\nshe   wished  they might be happy.'	1.986922711778796
"She answered him in the usual\nway, and after a moment's pause, added,\n\n My eldest sister has been in town these three months."	1.9875026031025824
"Mr Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from\ntheir recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly\nexpressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own\ncarriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if\nshe had not happened to see Mr Jones's shop boy in the street, who had\ntold her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield\nbecause the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed\ntowards Mr Collins by Jane's introduction of him."	1.9876954218055727
"But Jane and Elizabeth, who\nagreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and\nconsequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,\nurged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her\nand her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was\nprevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished."	1.9877106303736356
"Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to\nme that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could\nnot rest till I knew the particulars."	1.9877921604499902
"He never\nsaid a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of\nlistening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre\nthat he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in\nbeing at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr\nand Mr Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her\nnot perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever\nshe came into Kent again she would be staying  there  too."	1.9900720926893785
'She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,\n\n You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way\nthat would have tempted me to accept it.'	1.9901013254873878
'She is a very fine-looking woman!'	1.9909189008169619
'In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her\nfather had been short and to the purpose.'	1.9909902252931584
'I know it to be impossible.'	1.9912187966779096
'I\n     thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes.'	1.9913428785342844
'Yes, very handsome.'	1.9913928710234727
'I will take care of\nmyself, and of Mr Wickham too.'	1.991517554080206
'But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an\nhour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her\nimpatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he\ndid not come back, she should think herself very ill used.'	1.992064577727577
'But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort\nfor it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect\nof their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished\nher all imaginable happiness.'	1.9922290194351377
'I did not know before,  continued Bingley immediately,  that you were a\nstudier of character.'	1.992315016871846
'My excellent father\n     died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr Wickham was to\n     the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it\n     to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his\n     profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a\n     valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became\n     vacant.'	1.992760895473967
"I felt a\nlittle uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in\nmarriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite\nright."	1.9928921310849137
"The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth\nmuch attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing\nbut think, and think with wonder, of Mr Darcy's civility, and above\nall, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister."	1.9930539227542063
"To these high\nflown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of\ndistrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she\nsaw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their\nabsence from Netherfield would prevent Mr Bingley's being there; and as\nto the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon\ncease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his."	1.9933370274902005
"Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so\nfavourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost\nsure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon."	1.9934757431296468
'He has\nchildren of his own, and may have more.'	1.9936831540256343
'But how came you to tell us that he was so\ndisagreeable?'	1.9945457015993713
'Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter\nand fainter; and in farther justification of Mr Darcy, she could not\nbut allow that Mr Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago\nasserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as\nwere his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their\nacquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much\ntogether, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing\nthat betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him\nof irreligious or immoral habits.'	1.9945702999899453
'It keeps him in good\nhumour,  said she,  and I am more obliged to you than I can express.'	1.9949163771515968
'I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very\n     much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live\n     upon without some help.'	1.9952133806523331
'You cannot be too much on your guard.'	1.995214840396126
"But in an instant arose the\ndreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr Darcy's\npleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this\nwas not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was\npronounced by his friend Mr Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and\nwho told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business\nthe day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant\nsmile,\n\n I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if\nhe had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here."	1.995524537583391
'She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and\nmother, both of whom had been dead many years.'	1.995722812423882
'The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost\ncontempt.'	1.9959470935370422
'With a stronger voice she soon added,  I have this comfort immediately,\nthat it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it\nhas done no harm to any one but myself.'	1.996096895939911
'But I believe your opinion of him would in general\nastonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly\nanywhere else.--Here you are in your own family.'	1.9966485038437845
'Sir William, how can you tell such a story?--Do not you know\nthat Mr Collins wants to marry Lizzy?'	1.996678540524208
'They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mr\nBennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail\nbitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of\nfive daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.'	1.9969933793165298
'But it was not to be.'	1.997016254773141
"Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's\nway."	1.9970587160636821
'Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his\ntime here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.'	1.997088359099602
'It cannot be for  me , it cannot be for  my  sake\nthat his manners are thus softened.'	1.997150597060174
'Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for\nthe kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice\nbeing given on such a point, without being resented.'	1.9975308061026993
'I know you do; and it is  that  which makes the wonder.'	1.99761774567015
'Had not my own feelings decided\nagainst you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been\nfavourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept\nthe man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the\nhappiness of a most beloved sister?'	1.998216407209379
'That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she\nhad ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she\ncould not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness\nof temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave\nof his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to\nthe caprice of their inclinations.'	1.999141475946023
'Elizabeth\nwas surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme,\nand, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him\nwould have been the last object of her wishes.'	1.9995389421503689
'I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and\nwill save all the best of the covies for you.'	1.99954891669577
'I do not know any body who seems\nmore to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr Darcy.'	1.999568236112955
'The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly\nwhat he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr Darcy,\nthough she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his\nown words.'	1.999848376087147
"But it ended in\nnothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again."	2.0001571886430893
'I do not cough for my own amusement,  replied Kitty fretfully.'	2.0001990361141515
"Charlotte's first letters\nwere received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be\ncuriosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would\nlike Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to\nbe; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte\nexpressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen."	2.0002258033355123
'However, your coming just at this time is the\ngreatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of\nlong sleeves.'	2.0002935282259013
'I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak\nwhat I think.'	2.0004934682785787
'She was not sorry, however, to\nhave the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from\nwhom they sprung.'	2.0010058272426368
'no--it is not for  me  to be driven away by Mr Darcy.'	2.001250902049441
'There is a lady, it seems, a\n     Mr Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was\n     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though\n     he did not say what.'	2.0017142803131445
'Mr Gardiner, who was several years younger than\nMr Bennet and Mr Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant\nwoman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces.'	2.0019224785885372
"A resemblance in good humour\nand good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of\ntheir  three  months' acquaintance they had been intimate  two ."	2.0024720832427634
'But there is one\nof her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I\ndare say, very agreeable.'	2.0031133709439466
'I cannot see why Mr Forster should not ask  me  as well as Lydia, \nsaid she,  though I am  not  her particular friend.'	2.0034561176804053
'But she would not\nallow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be\nsaid, for the present.'	2.004375550342062
'Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth\nagain, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to\nmake after all their Hertfordshire friends.'	2.0043914649443173
"I have told Miss Bennet several times, that\nshe will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though\nMr Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often\ntold her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in\nMr Jenkinson's room."	2.0045396368854416
'The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the\nworld, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,\nthey had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.'	2.004672036730075
'Something he supposed might be attributed\nto his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much\nattention in the whole course of his life.'	2.004773029976275
'His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living\nbut three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;\nand then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of\nJane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as\nshe could do.'	2.005134301142147
"Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by\nwhat he said of Mr Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but\nwonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of\nhis seeing too  little , she might have fancied too  much ."	2.0052291291971645
'Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\ncontinue the subject.'	2.0052718698640977
'I  did  hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so\npalatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually\ndeclared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business\nhad been compromised accordingly.'	2.0053725027343643
'That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.'	2.0054571504162513
'But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,  said Jane.'	2.005596177135826
'But against this, there were objections; and she finally\nresolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as\nto the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.'	2.0061156136824034
'I see what you are feeling,  replied Charlotte,-- you must be\nsurprised, very much surprised,--so lately as Mr Collins was wishing to\nmarry you.'	2.0063938323894117
'Miss Bingley sees that her brother is\nin love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.'	2.006690830864347
'Shall we ask him why a man of sense and\neducation, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend\nhimself to strangers?'	2.0067321127764215
'After an affectionate\nparting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by\nMr Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning\nher with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks\nfor the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his\ncompliments to Mr and Mr Gardiner, though unknown.'	2.007080530565748
'But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect\nof her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her\nspirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had\nnot seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to\nthe oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular\nnotice.'	2.007104979051632
'If you and Miss\nBennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very\nthankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.'	2.00711732351991
'And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\ncredit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more\nthan I ever look into.'	2.0071552123777403
'He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.'	2.0078631573920753
'The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have\na daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as\nmuch entailed as ever.'	2.0078757621069387
'I would go and see her, if I could have the\ncarriage.'	2.0083748467098625
'Though I\n know  it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him\nso much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on\nsetting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to\nyou.'	2.009066122634054
'It\nwas spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr Collins joining\nin, observed,\n\n Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine\nde Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will\nbe delighted with her.'	2.009194689677546
"They agreed that Mr Bennet should only hear of the departure of the\nfamily, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;\nbut even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,\nand she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen\nto go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together."	2.009439715195459
'On this subject, what can you have to\nsay?'	2.009700470019885
'Risk any thing rather than her\ndispleasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us\nagain, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,\nand be satisfied that  we  shall take no offence.'	2.009892145166007
'cried Elizabeth, as soon as they\nwere by themselves.'	2.0100234895757465
'Two of her\ngirls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing\nin it.'	2.010379596236745
'He\nhad always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his\nwife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was\npaid, she had no knowledge of it.'	2.010686728231158
'He\nbore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that\nBingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes\nlikewise turned towards Mr Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing\nalarm.'	2.0106965251773166
'But I will not be alarmed though your sister  does  play so well.'	2.0110063474274167
"Wickham's affection for Lydia, was just what Elizabeth had expected to\nfind it; not equal to Lydia's for him."	2.011109144589728
'Mr Bennet was quite in the fidgets.'	2.0118317059076567
'And I do not think it of light importance\nthat he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every\nbody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.'	2.012119422293116
'I told him, moreover, that I believed myself\nmistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent\nto him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was\nunabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.'	2.0123295004190203
'Do you not know that such a\nreport is spread abroad?'	2.014208778452812
'She could not imagine what business he could have in town\nso soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that\nhe might be always flying about from one place to another, and never\nsettled at Netherfield as he ought to be.'	2.0146586279948404
'He had never before supposed\nthat, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be\ndone with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present\narrangement.'	2.0146768545007823
"She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his\nbeing partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mr\nCollins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of\nraising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her\nopinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would\nvanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power."	2.015021702471776
'Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit\ndown for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr Darcy had been\nstanding near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and\nMr Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his\nfriend to join it.'	2.0153354245484825
'Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat\nthe matter as you do now.'	2.015513274690575
'Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.'	2.01560858369055
"He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's\nrecollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen\nhim often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man,\nasked her how she had liked him."	2.0157470402363815
'But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\nopportunity.'	2.0157743859475685
'What Wickham had said of the living\nwas fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was\nimpossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the\nother; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did\nnot err.'	2.0160631192747958
'She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it\nwas rather too early to begin.'	2.016215269745737
'And of this place,  thought she,  I might have been mistress!'	2.0162881656405633
'When all this was resolved\n     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at\n     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more\n     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to\n     receive the last finish.'	2.016419417985295
'He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down\nthe dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often\nwalk to Meryton.'	2.016419504118462
"Had she not seen him in\nDerbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no\nother view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial\nto Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming\nthere  with  his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come\nwithout it."	2.0168749279444413
'If I\nhad known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on\nhim.'	2.0173681760416105
'The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I\nthink it is well expressed.'	2.017422585303955
'How is\nsuch a man to be worked on?'	2.017503116587057
'Aye, there she comes,  continued Mr Bennet,  looking as unconcerned\nas may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided\nshe can have her own way.--But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take\nit into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,\nyou will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is\nto maintain you when your father is dead.-- I  shall not be able to keep\nyou--and so I warn you.--I have done with you from this very day.--I\ntold you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you\nagain, and you will find me as good as my word.'	2.018079254809118
'But here he was set right by Mr Bennet, who assured\nhim with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good\ncook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.'	2.0181470359630045
'But of course she did not mention my name to you.'	2.01848102170379
'And to be kept back on  such  a motive!--I think it\nwould not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of\nmind.'	2.018639467856187
'Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the\nnext day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr\nWickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\nwould come in the evening.'	2.0189181180843896
'Certainly,  replied Elizabeth-- there are such people, but I hope I am\nnot one of  them .'	2.018970700180266
'You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me\nto play and sing before any body and every body!--If my vanity had taken\na musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would\nreally rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of\nhearing the very best performers.'	2.0192758443526913
'CHAPTER VI.\n\n\nThe whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr Bennet the next\nmorning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.'	2.0193409868214887
'Not that I  shall  though,  she added to herself, as she finished the\nletter;  and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable\nmanner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it\nout.'	2.0203339910420586
'Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do every\nthing in his power to satisfy us on this head.'	2.02048442864421
'He\ncertainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that\nlook was disputable.'	2.0207194664915735
'In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been\ntoo busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their\nappearance before.'	2.0213181852822837
'If he did\nshrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.'	2.021423027767337
'It was in the Times and the Courier, I know;\nthough it was not put in as it ought to be.'	2.021424422313981
'She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to\nhim she had hardly courage to speak.'	2.021443251588159
'She longed to\nspeak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mr\nBennet began repeating her thanks to Mr Bingley for his kindness to\nJane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy.'	2.0216468373131202
'Perhaps I do.'	2.0218829898608766
'And so, my dear sister, I find from our uncle and aunt, that\nyou have actually seen Pemberley.'	2.0219117189308355
"Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;\nand in the evening Mr Bennet's invention was again at work to get\nevery body away from him and her daughter."	2.022152705667048
'Well,  said Charlotte,  I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if\nshe were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a\nchance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a\ntwelvemonth.'	2.0222080409803214
'She longed to see Mr Philips, the Lucases, and all\ntheir other neighbours, and to hear herself called  Mr Wickham,  by\neach of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her\nring and boast of being married, to Mr Hill and the two housemaids.'	2.0222899395828926
"He  was\n     exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I\n     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with  her  behaviour\n     while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter\n     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a\n     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no\n     fresh pain."	2.0226253099068336
'The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,\nwas at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did?'	2.0228150625531756
'And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to\n     suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness\n     of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree\n     of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of\n     yourself and Mr Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own\n     disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of\n     such an enormity, at so early an age.'	2.023234094602794
'He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that\nbusiness with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours\nbefore the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.'	2.0241244665075913
'Why was he to be the judge?'	2.0246264698214014
'Teaze him--laugh at\nhim.--Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.'	2.0246351245461374
"To be sure, Lizzy,  said her aunt,  he is not so handsome as Wickham;\nor rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are\nperfectly good."	2.024654093236407
'After\nlamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking\nthat Mr Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn,\nand the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though\nhe had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have\ntwo full courses.'	2.0249052313883413
'CHAPTER XVII.\n\n\nElizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr\nWickham and herself.'	2.0249965050570617
'Lady Lucas quieted her fears a\nlittle by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a\nlarge party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr Bingley\nwas to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.'	2.0250809772140856
"Elizabeth, who had a letter\nto write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;\nfor as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be\nwanted to counteract her mother's schemes."	2.0257145684086484
'And there are other\ncircumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to\nrelate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.'	2.0258171906456526
'To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to\nexpose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would\nhave been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or\nfiner success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister\nthat some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his\nfeelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he\nmust have witnessed.'	2.02620708096318
'On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two,\nwho were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as\nsportsmen, were in very good time.'	2.0265873686691345
'The subject elevated him\nto more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect\nhe protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a\nperson of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself\nexperienced from Lady Catherine.'	2.0270386371636078
"CHAPTER IX.\n\n\nElizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the\nmorning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the\nenquiries which she very early received from Mr Bingley by a housemaid,\nand some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his\nsisters."	2.027709488580414
'It was\ngenerally evident whenever they met, that he  did  admire her; and to\n her  it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference\nwhich she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\nway to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it\nwas not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane\nunited with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a\nuniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the\nsuspicions of the impertinent.'	2.0277255721422915
'Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\nwaiting-woman was in it.'	2.0278433131380322
'said Charlotte, as soon as he was\ngone.'	2.028279116114412
'Do you not consider that a connection with you,\nmust disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?'	2.0288698904534583
'Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep\nhis house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming\nneighbour in her.'	2.029184555052396
'The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her\nfather, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.'	2.029256151127913
'When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.'	2.0299042960911313
'The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold\nin his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what\nwe shall do.'	2.029996966744981
'You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me\nthe happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the\namusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us\nfor one half hour.'	2.0302882667982702
'Well girls,  said she, as soon as they were left to themselves,  What\nsay you to the day?'	2.0307162005936106
'She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell\nher, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner\nconnected with the letter he held.'	2.030857850929464
'Tell him I hope he will\n     excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at\n     the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.'	2.031226646400125
"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his\nill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite\na misfortune to be liked by him."	2.0313326172924913
'With a\nbook he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\ngood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised\nsuch splendid expectations.'	2.031469584475179
'I\n     take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,\n     but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging\n     you all to come here, as soon as possible.'	2.03197736615581
'It had not been very great; he had lost every point;\nbut when Mr Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured\nher with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance,\nthat he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not\nmake herself uneasy.'	2.0324222952790048
'He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them\ndressed.'	2.0324416751736436
"He had rather hoped that all his wife's\nviews on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he\nhad a very different story to hear."	2.032757295550066
"She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an\ninmate of Mr Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of\nthe latter with regard to new furniture."	2.0327637181534364
'It is impossible that he should still love\nme.'	2.0329309938017484
"At one time she had almost resolved on applying to\nhim, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and\nat length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr Darcy would never\nhave hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his\ncousin's corroboration."	2.0332681520905718
'I knew it myself, as\n     it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant\n     of it.--That they might have met without ill consequence, is\n     perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough\n     extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--Perhaps this\n     concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--It is done, however,\n     and it was done for the best.--On this subject I have nothing more\n     to say, no other apology to offer.'	2.033369421008396
'Yes, madam,  said Mr Bennet, delighted to speak to a lady Catherine.'	2.033383106980359
'In her own past\nbehaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in\nthe unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.'	2.0339115507292607
"They had, therefore, many\nacquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since\nthe death of Darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power\nto give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had\nbeen in the way of procuring."	2.0345815804072114
'There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will\ngive him a good name.'	2.036635096218953
'I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.'	2.0366825297741475
"Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of\nhis behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as\nguarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his\nrelations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different\nconstruction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor\nWickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire."	2.037198004545767
'said Mr Bennet, more than\nonce, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.'	2.037265625949153
"It must have been his sister's doing."	2.03762458778393
'With assumed tranquillity he then replied,  I have no wish of denying\nthat I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your\nsister, or that I rejoice in my success.'	2.03786291870173
"And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of\nthe girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,\n\n The men shan't come and part us, I am determined."	2.0380682144876197
'It must be an amusing study.'	2.0384609836777074
'He knows of my\n     being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and\n     yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to\n     persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy.'	2.038755007009143
'But Mr Gardiner\n     could not be seen, and Mr Darcy found, on further enquiry, that\n     your father was still with him, but would quit town the next\n     morning.'	2.03972470054981
'The Netherfield\nladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by\ntrade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well\nbred and agreeable.'	2.0399502149946707
'To know\nthat her daughter would be married was enough.'	2.0400326345921536
'His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade\n     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her\n     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,\n     offering his assistance, as far as it would go.'	2.040219897646419
'I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.'	2.0404639336166794
"Occupied in observing Mr Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth\nwas far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some\ninterest in the eyes of his friend."	2.0413909676525455
'My sole dependence was on you; and\nI am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.'	2.042996010078574
"The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a\nyoung gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been\nbrought up by him at his own expence.-- He is now gone into the army, \nshe added,  but I am afraid he has turned out very wild."	2.043560649493873
'said her aunt.'	2.0441443931907903
'If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form\nof encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as\nmay convince you of its being one.'	2.0451042708541385
"A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to\nElizabeth; but at last on Mr Bennet's leaving them together, after a\nlonger irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could\nnot help saying,\n\n Oh!"	2.0456194385585813
'But she is nothing to me now.'	2.045737358172952
'that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!'	2.0459946258803057
'She wished him to\nknow that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the\nplace, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\nvery unexpected-- for your housekeeper,  she added,  informed us that\nyou would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we\nleft Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in\nthe country.'	2.0465329627193873
'Yes, Sir; but I do not know when  that  will be.'	2.0467031176555404
"And with regard to the\nresentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former\n were  excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's\nconcern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in\nthe scorn."	2.046820469917034
'If you are a good\ngirl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of\nthem.'	2.046883219790988
'Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is\nbelieved that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.'	2.0469238203659486
'I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put\nit off, and then I should have gone quite distracted.'	2.0473123626846657
"It soothed,\nbut it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus\nself-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that\nJane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest\nrelations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt\nby such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she\nhad ever known before."	2.0484682741099416
'I think I have heard you say that you know them.'	2.0494783334305398
'Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mr\nBennet instantly answered,\n\n Oh dear!--Yes--certainly.--I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am\nsure she can have no objection.--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs.'	2.04967523916885
'Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not\nbeen the case.'	2.0497279629368133
'She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of\nWickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.'	2.0497337377547065
'Let me take it\nin the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.'	2.050240766552108
'It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr Bingley to see you\nall after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day\nbefore.'	2.0502701964956183
"He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are\nequal."	2.0506652396871314
'When\n     she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;\n     she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said\n     not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so\n     altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly\n     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.'	2.05112420116999
'He meant to provide for me amply,\nand thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\nelsewhere.'	2.0514456202092917
'I am thinking of what you have been telling me,  said she.'	2.052168515175329
'As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him\ncome home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult\ntogether as to what is to be done.'	2.052466419693692
'When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her\nhand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a\nsimpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant\nin the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence.'	2.0527046432612783
'When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be\ndone but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any\nintermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every\nsubject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have\nher judgment controverted.'	2.0528577752622104
'Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of\nher stay, as they had been at first.'	2.053120205527804
'I wonder when\nyou  would  have spoken, if I had not asked you!'	2.053162201294923
'His fear of her, has always operated, I\nknow, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his\nwish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he\nhas very much at heart.'	2.053192599154489
"I have not been used to submit to any person's whims."	2.0531985429824977
"The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's\nsituation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch."	2.0534328238362
'When Mr Bennet was told of this, she did\nnot express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering\nwhat her anxiety for his life had been before.'	2.0534722945121686
'Were it known to the rest\nof my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.'	2.053772080649386
"In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to\nthe compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did\nnot vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to\nreceive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost\nall compassion in anger."	2.054633793729588
'Only think what an establishment it would\nbe for one of them.'	2.0548909756514973
'He\nfound her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as\nunaffected, though not quite so chatty.'	2.0551511144985675
'We must not expect a lively young man\nto be always so guarded and circumspect.'	2.0552981658405813
"And in the wretched state of his own\nfinances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to\nhis fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired\nthat he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable\namount."	2.055646743049713
'CHAPTER XXII.\n\n\nThe Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the\nchief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr Collins.'	2.05614880695519
'but he was in such a hurry to be gone,\nand his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding\nout even so much as this.'	2.056413619595767
'I  should be\nashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.'	2.057461806501922
'The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a\nsecret.'	2.057679939644653
'Lizzy, you must not do so.'	2.057682417625297
'I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.'	2.057720520378336
"He had found the law a most unprofitable study,\n     and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would\n     present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there\n     could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other\n     person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered\n     father's intentions."	2.0577390113559053
'said she,  I heard you before; but I could not immediately\ndetermine what to say in reply.'	2.0580297264946026
'She had a sister married to a Mr Philips, who had been a clerk to their\nfather, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in\nLondon in a respectable line of trade.'	2.0584946208099657
'It was greatly my wish that he should do so,  he added,  as soon\n     as his marriage was fixed on.'	2.0586866104032757
'When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,\nand made the important communication.'	2.058693798494686
'Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for  us  to visit\nhim, if you do not.'	2.058773894722413
'Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get\nthe better of himself.'	2.059085871237506
'I am not ashamed of having been\nmistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of\nwhat I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.'	2.0592267890895113
'I know not, Miss Elizabeth,  said he,  whether Mr Collins has yet\nexpressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very\ncertain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for\nit.'	2.0592914052373157
'The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,\nthe Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its\nengagement.'	2.05947734050816
'After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows,\nto admire the view, Mr Collins attending them to point out its\nbeauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much\nbetter worth looking at in the summer.'	2.0596259350396484
'--It vexed her to see him\nexpose himself to such a man.'	2.0604302077052155
'She was teazed by\nMr Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he\ncould not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her\npower to dance with others.'	2.060692380896944
"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,  said\nElizabeth angrily;  for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse\nthan of being the son of Mr Darcy's steward, and of  that , I can\nassure you, he informed me himself."	2.061817288395383
'Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr and Mr Collins sat\ndown to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the\ntwo girls had the honour of assisting Mr Jenkinson to make up her\nparty.'	2.062735241754295
'I am sorry to hear  that ; but why did not you tell me so before?'	2.063163149633739
'I dare say Mr Bingley will be very\nglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\nhearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though\nI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.'	2.063254200761112
'I wonder,  said he, at the next opportunity of speaking,  whether he is\nlikely to be in this country much longer.'	2.0634053443858877
'There was no want of discourse.'	2.064150059290456
'However, I\nrecollected afterwards, that if he  had  been prevented going, the\nwedding need not be put off, for Mr Darcy might have done as well.'	2.064238192733654
'Yet, indeed, I am\nin earnest.'	2.0651045533899297
'It\nwas, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own\nwishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved\nhim, as now, when all love must be vain.'	2.065243569792705
'Mr Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not\nreturn it.'	2.066035725341928
'It is from my cousin, Mr Collins, who, when I am dead,\nmay turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.'	2.0660980168150385
'The second began.'	2.066924333703576
'Poor Charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to\nsuch society!--But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though\nevidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to\nask for compassion.'	2.0669495855415128
'They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their\nastonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mr\nBennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even\ninferior to what Elizabeth felt.'	2.06721718528756
'Her ladyship received them\ncivilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so\nacceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,\nalmost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,\nmuch more than to any other person in the room.'	2.0674881355974
'It is unlucky,  said she, after a short pause,  that you should not be\nable to see your friends before they leave the country.'	2.067640364113309
'As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be\nLady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her\nhalf-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,\nwhen the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr Darcy, and Mr\nDarcy only, entered the room.'	2.0684847399345108
'Lizzy,  said her father,  I have given him my consent.'	2.0690289390156265
"She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony\nwas not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it\npossible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every\nbetter feeling to worldly advantage."	2.069370307783918
'I  have  heard from authority, which I thought  as good , that it was\nleft you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.'	2.069482493122859
'no.--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\nfeelings.'	2.0697733568685583
'She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse\nwith her, he might have better success.'	2.0699816405707194
"Mr Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of\nBingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at\nlast; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy\nhumour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at\nnot seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals."	2.070020234431433
"CHAPTER XVII.\n\n\nElizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no\nlonger be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular\nin which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,\nshe related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr\nDarcy and herself."	2.070106587468151
'He scarcely ever spoke to\nher, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of\nhimself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose\ncivility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and\nespecially to her friend.'	2.0702316885276493
"I believe him to be Lady Catherine's  nephew ."	2.0705543019858834
'It was possible, however,\nthat some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more\ninformation; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the\napplication was a something to look forward to.'	2.0714481249772443
"When she thought\nof her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would\nnot allow that any objections  there  had material weight with Mr\nDarcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from\nthe want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want\nof sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly\ngoverned by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of\nretaining Mr Bingley for his sister."	2.0724949261311996
'I could not\nallow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months\nlast winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.'	2.0725650238048865
'But before she had been three minutes in her own room,\nher mother followed her.'	2.0726767518801883
'That is very true,  replied Elizabeth,  and I could easily forgive\n his  pride, if he had not mortified  mine .'	2.0728664210826255
"The possibility of Mr Collins's fancying himself in love with her\nfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but\nthat Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from\npossibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her\nastonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the\nbounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,\n\n Engaged to Mr Collins!"	2.072988191052945
"Widely\ndifferent was the effect of a second perusal.--How could she deny that\ncredit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to\ngive in the other?--He declared himself to have been totally\nunsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help\nremembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been.--Neither could she\ndeny the justice of his description of Jane.--She felt that Jane's\nfeelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a\nconstant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great\nsensibility."	2.0730945219881223
"Elizabeth received\nthem with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the\ngentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was\nready to take them all home."	2.073275933060989
"It will be in my power to\nassure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night."	2.0734312843377563
"Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr Darcy\nwas expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were\nnot many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would\nfurnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and\nshe might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him\nwere, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined\nby Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest\nsatisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and\nseemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by\nMiss Lucas and herself."	2.073452845479868
'That would be a good scheme,  said Elizabeth,  if you were sure that\nthey would not offer to send her home.'	2.0737865833728
'Impossible, Mr Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him\nmyself; how can you be so teazing?'	2.0739365797425964
'But do not imagine\nthat he is always here so often.'	2.0751040863960566
'In\nconfirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\ntransactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming\nher authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.'	2.0759692367817157
"I have not a doubt of Mr Bingley's sincerity,  said Elizabeth warmly;\n but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only."	2.077807607400955
'He protested that except Lady\nCatherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for\nshe had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even\npointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although\nutterly unknown to her before.'	2.0780927132626474
'She had been unwilling to\nmention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made\nher equally avoid the name of his friend.'	2.0781143136088014
'That his two sisters and Mr Darcy, however, should\nhave such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and\nshe could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or\nthe insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.'	2.0785127328150166
'Will you be very angry with me, my dear\n     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold\n     enough to say before) how much I like him.'	2.0788298616571024
'She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her\nhusband, called out as she entered the library,\n\n Oh!'	2.0793606982971253
"Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she\nknew not how to believe that Mr Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr\nBingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the\nveracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.--The\npossibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to\ninterest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be\ndone, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and\nthrow into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be\notherwise explained."	2.0795706597607144
'The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have\nanswered her hopes; but, alas!'	2.0796563949723956
'She assured him that no one intended to play, and the\nsilence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her.'	2.0798676148175725
'It was not all settled before Monday:'	2.0809504742191565
'Lizzy is not a bit better than the\nothers; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\ngood humoured as Lydia.'	2.0813475480646226
"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am?"	2.0813993591744357
'But perhaps you have\nbeen too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case\nyou may be sure of my pardon.'	2.081409015416346
'but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and\nwhen I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I\nthink it will be very tolerable.'	2.0819244047460845
"Colonel\nFitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was\ngenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told\nher; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of\nlove, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself\nseriously to work to find it out.--She watched him whenever they were at\nRosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success."	2.0819524005906413
'In anticipating the happiness of Bingley,\nwhich of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the\nconversation till they reached the house.'	2.0830097691718232
"Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister\nexcept Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr Collins was to attend them,\nat the request of Mr Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,\nand have his library to himself; for thither Mr Collins had followed\nhim after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with\none of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr\nBennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford."	2.0838815279491634
'It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of\nshort duration.'	2.0840521081771293
'Anne would have\nbeen a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.'	2.0842513022998683
'We\nshall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some\nballs, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.'	2.0846053045415567
"On\nMr and Mr Gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the\nhouse and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted\non each side with the utmost politeness."	2.0848255333367334
'On the following Monday, Mr Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her\nbrother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at\nLongbourn.'	2.0849135347070606
'Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;\nbut Mr Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the\naffair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.'	2.085620379310378
'No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her\nacceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.'	2.086264190889251
'She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.'	2.0867579637949225
'My poor father!'	2.0873086856570997
'There was too much to\nbe thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects.'	2.0874438770022357
"Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like\nman--he is a great friend of Darcy's."	2.088014895912893
'I thank you for my share of the favour,  said Elizabeth;  but I do not\nparticularly like your way of getting husbands.'	2.0881546481003808
'In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her\nfeelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily\nperceive that her spirits were affected by it.'	2.088577827902503
'Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\nvaluable neighbour to Mr Bennet.--They had several children.'	2.0888309780921746
'He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in\nthe world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.'	2.0893774524719055
'You could not have met with a person more capable of\ngiving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been\nconnected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy.'	2.090133660371105
'It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I\n     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.'	2.0903678374422427
'pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for\nthere is such a sight to be seen!'	2.090906156071443
'But I am particularly\nattached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to\nme!--They were excessively sorry to go!'	2.0909898698789284
'It is not\nof peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining.'	2.0910834662001037
'And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater\nbeauty.'	2.0913038419841166
'I am not to be intimidated into\nanything so wholly unreasonable.'	2.091352858536595
'Mr Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon\ndone--done while Mr Bennet was stirring the fire.'	2.0916353930151512
"It was some days, however, before they\nreceived any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the\nhouse, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,\nalmost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by\nsuch an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\ncome there in the evening."	2.0932932946178084
"He answered\nme with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,\nthat he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be\ncertain she could never bestow a favour unworthily."	2.09355437674645
'In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,  said Bingley;  and\nI hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.'	2.0937564560574593
"Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the\nsociety of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and\nElizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr\nWickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr Darcy's\nlooks and behaviour."	2.0949315712362355
"And is\n such  a girl to be my nephew's sister?"	2.0950180169894437
'No,  replied Jane,  I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\nsatisfactory to tell you.'	2.0958954782856227
'I am not one and twenty.'	2.0959722000750896
"It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that\nsuch a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very\nday of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late\nbreakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by\nsome exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it\nwould be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following\nmorning."	2.0963134600478464
'I wish I could say any thing to comfort you,  replied Elizabeth;  but\nit is wholly out of my power.'	2.0964531807693367
'I believe her to be both in a great degree,  replied Wickham;  I have\nnot seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked\nher, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.'	2.097481211257829
"Mr Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton\nassemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty\nwomen in the room, and  which  he thought the prettiest?"	2.097545548875302
'And if you will stay\nanother  month  complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as\nfar as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as\nDawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room\nfor one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I\nshould not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.'	2.0977407200596665
'Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her\nbrain; but she was satisfied with none.'	2.098074231726157
"Whilst wandering on in this\nslow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was\nquite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr Darcy\napproaching them, and at no great distance."	2.0985042245148593
'when I went away, I am sure\nI had no more idea of being married till I came back again!'	2.0986660067840175
'My mother means well;\nbut she does not know, no one can know how much I suffer from what she\nsays.'	2.100785659246556
'Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\naccomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\nfortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they\nhad yet learnt to care for at a ball.'	2.1008306166130657
'Surprise was the least\nof her feelings on this developement.'	2.10088290196216
'She was sure they should be married some time or\n     other, and it did not much signify when.'	2.101035924032329
'I told you the other day,\nof his infamous behaviour to Mr Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at\nLongbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved\nwith such forbearance and liberality towards him.'	2.1012221635640596
'To know\nthat she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish\nJane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own\nvanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation\nto openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision\nin which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate;\nand her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into\nrepeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister\nfarther.'	2.1013974608334
'They soon outstripped the others, and when they had\nreached the carriage, Mr and Mr Gardiner were half a quarter of a\nmile behind.'	2.101420964830551
'I have no pleasure in\ntalking to undutiful children.--Not that I have much pleasure indeed in\ntalking to any body.'	2.1016696544865314
'It was very little less.'	2.1021801673058205
"Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and\nthey continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put\nan end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr\nWickham's attentions."	2.1023636453445333
'how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would\nchaperon you about to all the balls.'	2.1029164820118003
'It ought to be good,  he replied,  it has been the work of many\ngenerations.'	2.1033610712845037
'No; but it must be done soon.'	2.103375962571064
'If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the\nyounger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time,\nfor from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was\nsuch a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.'	2.104741172252313
'But, my dear Elizabeth,  she added,  what sort of girl is Miss King?'	2.1047681190979417
"I do not see what right Mr Darcy had to decide on the propriety of\nhis friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to\ndetermine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy."	2.105146587387558
'With what delighted pride she\nafterwards visited Mr Bingley and talked of Mr Darcy may be guessed.'	2.1057415882785575
'At such a time, much might\nhave been said, and silence was very awkward.'	2.106565665277413
'Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,\nturned silently away.'	2.106621059779343
'He had been some time with Mr Gardiner, who, with two or three other\ngentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him\nonly on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to\nGeorgiana that morning.'	2.106648491259022
'Do let us have a little music, --cried Miss Bingley, tired of a\nconversation in which she had no share.-- Louisa, you will not mind my\nwaking Mr Hurst.'	2.106882639963756
'He did every\nthing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on\nthe first of September, than any body else in the country.'	2.108364224279918
'How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,\nshe could not imagine.'	2.108621295807247
'We will be down as soon as we can,  said Jane;  but I dare say Kitty is\nforwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.'	2.10872329715915
'I do not mind his not talking to Mr Long,  said Miss Lucas,  but I\nwish he had danced with Eliza.'	2.1091684954750214
'When Mr Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he\nsent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon\nas the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn.'	2.109426023798689
"Mr Bingley does not know the whole of his\nhistory, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\nprincipally offended Mr Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,\nthe probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that\nMr Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr Darcy than he has\nreceived; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his\nsister's, Mr Wickham is by no means a respectable young man."	2.110604493303807
'Mr Darcy danced\nonly once with Mr Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being\nintroduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in\nwalking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.'	2.1107453459346206
"When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my\nbrother Gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my\nsister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away."	2.1137199256608405
'That it ought not to be attempted.'	2.1143388539249615
'Why, my dear, you must know, Mr Long says that Netherfield is taken\nby a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came\ndown on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much\ndelighted with it that he agreed with Mr Morris immediately; that he is\nto take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be\nin the house by the end of next week.'	2.1152957078686967
'though I\nthought it would be very good fun if I was.'	2.115625668434994
"it is\nall for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to\nhim, except just now and then."	2.1171512447457217
'He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence;\nbut it had not been so in Derbyshire.'	2.117458379387503
"On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined\nwith others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth\ndisposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some\nenquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she\nmentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr Darcy's having both spent three\nweeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former."	2.11796506515778
'I do not blame Jane,  she continued,  for Jane would have got Mr\nBingley, if she could.'	2.1185841696893353
'Her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think\nhim less agreeable.'	2.119582872924751
'But I wonder how long you\n would  have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.'	2.1196693748838458
'Without supposing\nthem, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference\nof each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she\nresolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left\nHertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such\nan attachment.'	2.1197699840521387
'They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not\nlike at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency\nwithout fashion, which is intolerable.'	2.119868291670405
'Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the\nman and the match were quite good enough for  her , the worth of each\nwas eclipsed by Mr Bingley and Netherfield.'	2.1202064935081384
"Find such a woman as soon as\nyou can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the\nway, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and\nkindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\nadvantages in my power to offer."	2.120447653460757
'It may perhaps be pleasant,  replied Charlotte,  to be able to impose\non the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be\nso very guarded.'	2.121107159306591
'my dear,  cried his wife,  I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.'	2.1222349091360866
'Their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose\nto depart, Mr Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing\ntheir wish of seeing Mr and Mr Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner\nat Pemberley, before they left the country.'	2.1224051475046646
'When Denny,\nand Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they\ndid not know him in the least.'	2.122714890237078
'As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of\na favourable answer.'	2.123776252552134
'That Mr Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but\nwithout gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now\ndetermined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr Bennet\nthought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first\ncoming to London, before they procured lodgings.'	2.124388860644049
'She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss\nBingley was uncivil to  her , and more teazing than usual to himself.'	2.1250878298310094
'But it is so\nstrange!'	2.1253201473048287
'The church  ought  to have been my profession--I\nwas brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in\npossession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we\nwere speaking of just now.'	2.12555118328051
'I am sure,  she added,  if it was not for such good friends I do not\nknow what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a\nvast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is\nalways the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest\ntemper I ever met with.'	2.1258392271282087
'I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more.'	2.1259018884476855
'CHAPTER XI.\n\n\nWhen the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister,\nand seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the\ndrawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many\nprofessions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable\nas they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.'	2.1264073746305403
'Till I was in Kent, and saw\nso much both of Mr Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was\nignorant of the truth myself.'	2.1267970741283295
'We must not be so ready to fancy\nourselves intentionally injured.'	2.1271530794434654
'But\n     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he\n     wanted.'	2.128809382875226
'It has been my own doing,\nand I ought to feel it.'	2.1289322994529662
'Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,\nbecause it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a\ngirl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is\nmercenary.'	2.12961362170274
'I know my dear uncle and\n     aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have\n     still something more to ask of the former.'	2.1297036624330463
'I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had.'	2.13011766420161
'And you may be certain that when I have the honour of\nseeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,\neconomy, and other amiable qualifications.'	2.1301783983881686
'My father and Maria are to come to me in March,  added Charlotte,  and\nI hope you will consent to be of the party.'	2.1313687718018555
"Mr Darcy's\nshameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a\nkeener sense of her sister's sufferings."	2.1314337472446874
'They are not married,\n     nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are\n     willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on\n     your side, I hope it will not be long before they are.'	2.133014726731193
"Miss Darcy, on her brother's\nentrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he\nwas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,\nas much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side."	2.1332916150559287
'She could not help frequently\nglancing her eye at Mr Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what\nshe dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was\nconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.'	2.1335184697278966
'Mr Collins was also in the same state of angry pride.'	2.1335218527384163
'I was so vexed to see him stand\nup with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all:'	2.1337948222857936
'Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though\nthe carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking\nwas her only alternative.'	2.1339023429140314
'If it was not allowable for him to gain  my \naffections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for\nmaking love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally\npoor?'	2.1340209217219472
'I do not know who is\ngood enough for him.'	2.134156204857058
'Only think of  that  my dear; he actually danced with her\ntwice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second\ntime.'	2.134384297575979
'CHAPTER II.\n\n\nElizabeth had settled it that Mr Darcy would bring his sister to visit\nher, the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently\nresolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.'	2.1355267405186176
"But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be\nsuspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mr\nGardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him."	2.1364662063516575
'His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of\nthe highest kind.'	2.1368588978325573
'I will go directly to Mr Bennet, and\nwe shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.'	2.1376660096128406
"Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mr Collins you\nhave been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear\nthat your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be\nas well to be silent."	2.1378059120943993
'I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly\nbeyond my own party.'	2.139146153865716
'Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a\n scheme  of infamy.'	2.139336709202043
'You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and\nof course she will be always at Pemberley with you.'	2.139472752930479
"Mr Denny and Mr Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of\nMr Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's\npressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mr\nPhilips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the\ninvitation."	2.1397626800803153
'I did not know before, that I had  two  daughters on the brink\nof matrimony.'	2.1400592097288302
'Mr Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling\nsolemnity replied,\n\n It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your\ntime not disagreeably.'	2.1402558892608465
'Your\n     father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they\n     had a great deal of talk together.'	2.141986642353492
'The carriage was sent to meet\nthem at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time.'	2.142542154443531
'Mr Bennet was quite\ndisconcerted.'	2.1440394879681595
'I found,  said he,  as the time drew near, that I had better not meet\nMr Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so\nmany hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes\nmight arise unpleasant to more than myself.'	2.145555904294418
'He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.'	2.14669301567034
'Mr Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have\ntwo daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of\nthe day before, was now high in her good graces.'	2.1487966019795457
'At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,\n\n And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!'	2.14888450435014
'But do you think she\nwould be prevailed on to go back with us?'	2.1503182118095308
'It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of\n     the kingdom.'	2.1504237169932248
'She could not yet recover from the\nsurprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing\nelse, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after\nbreakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise.'	2.150637936588451
'I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with\nyou as ever.'	2.1524082103138635
"They had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was\nalso coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her\nsatisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step\nwas heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room."	2.1534451420583363
'Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their\nsafe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it\nwould be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.'	2.1538932380583655
'But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down\nwithout one of her sisters.'	2.155194356476977
'Secondly, that I am convinced it will add\nvery greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have\nmentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation\nof the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.'	2.1552417521360074
'And  that  I suppose is one of your sisters.'	2.156740265716759
'Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a\nvery different man from what he is to the less prosperous.'	2.1579775319758965
'Mr Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as\nsoon as they were gone Mr Collins began.'	2.158217054861337
'The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mr\nBennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy\nwas over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the\nwhile.'	2.1583664945057177
'If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.'	2.158520055556127
'She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of\nadmiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because\nhe disliked her, was still more strange.'	2.158589958319654
'But I was not then\n     master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.'	2.1590870849815653
'For a few moments, indeed,\nshe felt that he would probably strike into some other path.'	2.1592445565817915
'She is\na very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but\nI will  make  her know it.'	2.1595643547059646
'Mr and Mr Gardiner smiled.'	2.159588578061745
'And she was only sixteen last June.'	2.1629648023013797
'It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,  said\nBingley.'	2.1647286714222416
'Without a governess you must\nhave been neglected.'	2.1657431831692726
'Mr Darcy!'	2.166132889864981
'Mr Darcy!'	2.166132889864981
'You know it is not\nsound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.'	2.1671383316228483
'I should never have said Mr Collins\nwas settled  near  her family.'	2.167381613717868
'She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see\nwhether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the\nBingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he\nanswered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.'	2.1676432858252
'It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.'	2.1679031499239754
'But it is all, all too late now.'	2.1684249314657777
"But, perhaps he could not in her mother's\npresence be what he was before her uncle and aunt."	2.1684473044382324
'But her mind was so busily engaged,\nthat she did not always know when she was silent.'	2.168590366717937
"Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her\nfather's behaviour as a husband."	2.1686529523210707
'I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.'	2.16913942887812
'You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not\nconceal your age.'	2.169209390431841
'Your sisters are engaged, and there is not\nanother woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to\nstand up with.'	2.169265579500317
'My dear Mr Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of\ntheir father and mother.--When they get to our age I dare say they will\nnot think about officers any more than we do.'	2.169546450420614
"Such were the gentle murmurs of Mr Bennet, and they\ngave way only to the greater distress of Mr Bingley's continued\nabsence."	2.1695919139085316
'I do not at\n     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but\n     if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should\n     be deceived again.'	2.1699514564306033
'He must go\n     somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have\n     nothing to live on.'	2.170075445191462
"This, she would not hear of; but she was not so\nunwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled\nthat Mr Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet\nwere not decidedly better."	2.1712835139554003
'She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till\nlate in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and\nwhen it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go\ndown stairs herself.'	2.171453060099702
'You look pale.'	2.174047402934578
'A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her\nalarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\ncuriosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the\nnext morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and\nwith a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike\nto the scheme.'	2.1759156890545728
'It does not often happen\nthat the interference of friends will persuade a young man of\nindependent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in\nlove with only a few days before.'	2.1763347667165203
'Elizabeth\nsmiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.'	2.177259725057305
'I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have\nseen it in the papers.'	2.177293512598778
'He said as little as he had ever been in the\nhabit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him\naway, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of\nit.'	2.1780434271021556
'I will not tell you what it is.'	2.1781458770748383
'It was a subject which they could not mention before me.'	2.1785613625834417
"it must be my uncle's doings!"	2.179506731097746
'Another time, Lizzy,  said her mother,  I would not dance with  him ,\nif I were you.'	2.179852383920826
'Mr Darcy looked just as he had been\nused to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual\nreserve, to Mr Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her\nfriend, met her with every appearance of composure.'	2.1807234754079947
'She is a most charming young lady indeed.'	2.1811954824348407
'She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear\nof seeing Mr Darcy--that Mr Darcy might leave the country, but that\n he  should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball\nthe very next week.'	2.182886280347181
'The whole of what Elizabeth had already\nheard, his claims on Mr Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,\nwas now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was\npleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr Darcy before they\nhad known any thing of the matter.'	2.1834737701945452
'He did not\n     leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a\n     gentleman had called on business.'	2.1838781077823985
'If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as\nyou.'	2.183925624993385
"It was the favourite wish of\n his  mother, as well as of her's."	2.1841124777519934
'She could\nthink of nothing but of Mr Wickham, and of what he had told her, all\nthe way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as\nthey went, for neither Lydia nor Mr Collins were once silent.'	2.1847402079085665
'But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see\nwhat he is about.'	2.185782786277928
'Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.'	2.1858148177202734
'I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,  said he, as soon\nas she allowed him to speak.'	2.1864106220431427
'She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on\nthe subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.'	2.1868426253059488
'You are determined to ruin him in\nthe opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.'	2.187259459383483
'As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she\nunderstood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and\nNetherfield, and she blushed as she answered,\n\n I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her\nfamily.'	2.1874443158326917
'You do not\nknow what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in\nsuch terms.'	2.1883606058099203
'I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have\nsupposed about Mr Bingley.'	2.1886899940844886
'If you love Mr Darcy half as well as I do my dear\n     Wickham, you must be very happy.'	2.188851885734058
'Indeed, Mr Bennet,  said she,  it is very hard to think that Charlotte\nLucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to\nmake way for  her , and live to see her take my place in it!'	2.1897810371389834
'You do not look\nwell.'	2.190284733227634
'I have\nnot the smallest hope.'	2.1921201026990866
"Elizabeth listened as little as she\ncould, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name."	2.1926191108899236
"It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be\ngenerally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family,\nit would be an unpleasant thing."	2.195499609547111
"Mr Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned\ninstantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the\nremarks of the two ladies and Mr Darcy; the latter of whom, however,\ncould not be prevailed on to join in their censure of  her , in spite of\nall Miss Bingley's witticisms on  fine eyes ."	2.1955957599067117
'He did not talk to me of his own arts,  said Fitzwilliam smiling.'	2.1960516089271294
'In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make\nher resigned.'	2.1964429545351605

'Mr Darcy had at first scarcely\nallowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the\nball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.'	2.2033942610128965
'They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr Gardiner, after\ngeneral assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told\nher that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist\nMr Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.'	2.2035181224039877

'I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr Darcy has no defect.'	2.2087434672029786
'Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help\nfancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect\nand its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if\nwishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.'	2.2113764555966555
'He observed to her, at a\nmoment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had\nsomething of real regret, that it  was a very long time since he had had\nthe pleasure of seeing her;  and, before she could reply, he added,  It\nis above eight months.'	2.2118948768515194
'Mr Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been\ndistinguished by his sisters.'	2.2120436915661257

'How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that\nI should be so reasonable as to admit it!'	2.2180657753332653
'Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference\nof his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving\nheart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice\nher against him.'	2.2191592334886696
'I am not afraid of you,  said he, smilingly.'	2.2193917114918014
'When I am in the country,  he replied,  I never wish to leave it; and\nwhen I am in town it is pretty much the same.'	2.2212784878949368

'CHAPTER XIII.\n\n\n I hope, my dear,  said Mr Bennet to his wife, as they were at\nbreakfast the next morning,  that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,\nbecause I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.'	2.2240807120108657
'And with no one to speak to, of what I\nfelt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and\nvain and nonsensical as I knew I had!'	2.224386022185753
'Well, my dear,  said Mr Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note\naloud,  if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she\nshould die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of\nMr Bingley, and under your orders.'	2.2248237754829416
'Dining out,  said Mr Bennet,  that is very unlucky.'	2.2283615779990202

'I shall not say that you are mistaken,  he replied,  because you could\nnot really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I\nhave had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you\nfind great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact\nare not your own.'	2.2539681800779547

'My dear Madam,  he replied,  this invitation is particularly\ngratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you\nmay be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as\npossible.'	2.2616045463969043

'I am perfectly serious in my refusal.--You could not make  me \nhappy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who\nwould make  you  so.--Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I\nam persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the\nsituation.'	2.2688909852508625

'I have no reason, I assure you,  said he,  to be dissatisfied with my\nreception.'	2.285348217560164
'The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so\nsoon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be\nsafe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where\nshe felt herself to be right.'	2.2857088452471794

'my uncle and aunt would have been lost\nto me:'	2.294705969087599
'I do not know the\nparticulars, but I know very well that Mr Darcy is not in the least to\nblame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that\nthough my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his\ninvitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had\ntaken himself out of the way.'	2.295120161385813
'But it is fortunate,  thought she,  that I have something to wish for.'	2.2953369112424427
'I should not be surprised,  said Darcy,  if he were to give it up, as\nsoon as any eligible purchase offers.'	2.2968886050359845
'Well, he is a\nvery undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least\nchance in the world of her ever getting him now.'	2.296913272508872
'Indeed I had.'	2.297090203947104
'Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!'	2.2975062983273924
"They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every\nthing but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mr Gardiner\nthought of him, and Mr Gardiner would have been highly gratified by\nher niece's beginning the subject."	2.2981026538133533
'To Mr Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at\nNetherfield long enough.'	2.298302331287202
"To the civil enquiries which then\npoured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the\nmuch superior solicitude of Mr Bingley's, she could not make a very\nfavourable answer."	2.2983557642277566
'Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect\nindifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and\nher hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the\nnext morning to London.'	2.298664467059052
'But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that\nBingley was the person meant.'	2.3014653852235507
'But it ought to\nbe done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done\ndirectly.'	2.3019844192379355
'You will not be fit to be seen when you get\nthere.'	2.302150997206479

'She will be down in a moment I dare say.'	2.306797073723602
"As\nsoon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her\ncousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,\nfor Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was."	2.30695475073588
'Of Mr Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far\nas their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.'	2.30871636556745
'She was very\nequal therefore to address Mr Bingley on the subject of the ball, and\nabruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most\nshameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.'	2.3096165512974673

'If she heard me,\n     it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen.'	2.3138828824568267
'If I was to go through the world, I could not\nmeet with a better.'	2.313992751996471
'I do not believe a word of it, my dear.'	2.3142726119285615
"She dared not relate the other\nhalf of Mr Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she\nhad been valued by his friend."	2.317940489498288
'But, though\nthis might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour\nto Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane.'	2.3223711432197183
'I am astonished, my dear,  said Mr Bennet,  that you should be so\nready to think your own children silly.'	2.323923184278059
'Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,\nand that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without\ncalling her attention.'	2.327374517337395
'Miss Bennet,  replied her ladyship, in an angry tone,  you ought to\nknow, that I am not to be trifled with.'	2.328861092743228
'I did not think Mr\nGardiner was so little to be trusted.'	2.329221240180999

'It is a great comfort to have you\n     so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will\n     think of us.'	2.33285032136116
'He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure\n I  never want to see him again.'	2.333206914563845
'I will not trust myself on the subject,  replied Wickham,   I  can\nhardly be just to him.'	2.3357864388008167
'And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be\nBingley.'	2.336222929094604
'You will be a very happy woman.'	2.342726194230787
'That he had been concerned in the measures\ntaken to separate Mr Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she\nhad always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and\narrangement of them.'	2.342758790713187
'With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added,  How long did you\nsay that he was at Rosings?'	2.342813841386024
'Aye, so it is,  cried her mother,  and Mr Long does not come back\ntill the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him,\nfor she will not know him herself.'	2.3452289365854617
'I would not be so fastidious as you are,  cried Bingley,  for a\nkingdom!'	2.3461299387253645
'My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now.'	2.348013789978147
