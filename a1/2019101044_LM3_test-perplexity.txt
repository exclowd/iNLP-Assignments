sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and\nhe went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was\nlooking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits\nmaking as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit\nthere isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling\nespecially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl\ndown there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather\ninstead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not\nlike me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the\nsame on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way\nhe plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the\nplace lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming\nin without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as\nI was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then\ndoing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to\nlook at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack\nstatue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got\nthat little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for 2\nshillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right\nnot to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at\nthe table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to\nunderstand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant\nsay I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and\nhelping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its\nme shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on\nthe shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now\nshes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me\nwhistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly\ncome out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her\nround in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well\nhe sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to\ngo on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I\nsmelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I\nsewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I\ntell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a\nparting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out\nno matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your\nblouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle\nblackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on\nshow on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at\nher like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you\nthen a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the\nTheatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me\nafraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that\ntouching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always\ntrying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for\nBeerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed\nlike that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me\nthere and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to\nget near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same\nlittle game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but\nhe didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the\nBroadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance\non her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands\nswollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything\ndeep yet I never came properly till I was what 22 or so it went into\nthe wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that\nConny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with\nsealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he\nlooked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and\nsupper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man\ngives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a\nfew men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it\nreally happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love\nin their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each\nother that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit\nfoolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and\npoison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes\nalways making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to\nput her hair up at 15 my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time\nenough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes\npretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too\nbut theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a\nfishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we\nmet MrJoe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to\nsee us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough\ntill I gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that\nnow for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me\nthat exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because\nhow was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night\nbefore cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to\nleave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as\nshe said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was\nthe last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself\nthey darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the\ntwo of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever\ngoing to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming\nId have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that\nold MrFleming you have to be walking round after her putting the\nthings into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course\nshes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly\ndishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something\nand opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends\nto entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you\nplease that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father\nsuch a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the\ncricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at\nthe other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won\nthem in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody\nsaw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand\nfuneral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody\nhawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head\nI ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been\nhanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the\nironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was\nsomething else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and\nnow shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband\ngetting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they\nhave to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats\nher Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres\nsome new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead\nin my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if\nIm let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt\nthat afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he\nhad up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that\npester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows\ntheres always something wrong with us 5 days every 3 or 4 weeks usual\nmonthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like\nthat the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him\nto see MrKendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about\ninsurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt\ngive in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his\nglasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul\nthats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could\nall in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it\nout then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry\nsupposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery\nhissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a\nwoman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up\nfor it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is\nbetter off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience\nabove its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me\npregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just\nput on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn\nit and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a\nvirgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you\ncould be a widow or divorced 40 times over a daub of red ink would do\nor blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this\npooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what\nbetween clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too\njingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the\nother side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor\nwith the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think\nit is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I\nmight look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next\ntime he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face\nwheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me\nafter that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I\nmade him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse\nand skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be\nhe never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits\neasy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling\nlike a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for\na wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning\ndont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look\nhow white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit\nhere how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get\nup on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey\nlily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore\n\nwho knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I\nsomething growing in me getting that thing like that every week when\nwas it last I Whit Monday yes its only about 3 weeks I ought to go to\nthe doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that\nwhite thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick\nDr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called\nit I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting\nround those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every\nlittle fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of\ncourse so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last\nman in the world besides theres something queer about their children\nalways smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what\nI did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one\nthing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly\nold face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and\ncould you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the\nrock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by\nthe way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I\ncan squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and\nneedles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by\nMillys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the\nsame paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and\nasking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all\nthe words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked\nsideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows\nwhat else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out\nfrowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you\nlying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever\nenough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad\ncrazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious\nBody everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and\nof joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he\nhad me always at myself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and I said I\nhadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him\nup I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited\nme I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in\nRehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about 10 minutes\nas if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking\nafter my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half\nsloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand\nfor a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his\nblather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool\nof a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O\nbeau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and\nrigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy\nanything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st\nopportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom\npretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk\nand sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I\nlaughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight\nsitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so\nthat a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose\nthere isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at\nthe way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard\nbolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth\nbreathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to\nshow one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a\npinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out\nthat he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put\ntogether all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody\nI suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big\nsquare feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway\nwheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt\ncreak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere\nstill she must have given him great value for his money of course he\nhas to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll\nhave something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God\nhelp us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always\nreminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often\nenough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to\nadmire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like\nmy bed God here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many houses\nwere we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard\nstreet and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on\nthe run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the\nmen with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse\nand worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always\nsomebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always\nknow who was in there last every time were just getting on right\nsomething happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr\nCuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old\nlottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives\nimpudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the\nFreeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the\nfreemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along\nin the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much\nconsolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed\njudging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres\nGeorges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour wait two oclock well\nthats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody\nclimbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that\nlittle habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if\nhe has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I\ndont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their\nlies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont\nbelieve you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats\nMasterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in\nreal life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is\ndisgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads\nand no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about\nwith not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow\npoison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both\nsides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let\nhim lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the\none thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews\nused when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast\nor speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough\nfor one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his\nown pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that\nwethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and\nlock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder\nwas it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too\nno hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants\nme and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that\nforlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some\nlittle bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the\nCollege races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his\nnob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at\nthose two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no\nuse of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr\nPaddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in\nthe paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd\nbe something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind\nin black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that\nbit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or\nother and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys\nhusband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye\ntrying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old\ngreen dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way\nlike dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call\nthat friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with\ntheir wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping\nthat barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be\nsick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still\nthough hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of\nthem well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches\nif I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well\nwhen he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to\nsquander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after\nhis wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im\nsorry in a way for him what are his wife and 5 children going to do\nunless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some\npub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come\nhome her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully\nbecoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at\nthe Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he\nborrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and\nsquashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a\nwellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough\nthat must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the\npreserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and\nSimon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the\nsecond verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly\nsang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying\ntoo when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had\na delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart\n sweet heart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet  tart \ngoodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in\nit all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we\nsang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even\ntransposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed\nsay or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I\nwonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a\nuniversity professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he\ndriving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have\ngot it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look\nyoung in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and\nme too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge\nstation with his father and mother I was in mourning thats 11 years ago\nnow yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into mourning for\nwhat was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for\nme I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted\nhed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time\nhe was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord\nFauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw\nhim at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God\nyes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out\nthe deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met\nbefore I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either\nbesides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after\nthat the 10 of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on\nits way and scandals too the 3 queens and the 8 of diamonds for a rise\nin society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments look\nat that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about\npoetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or\nstanding up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only\ngetting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry\nwhen I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not\nan ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I\nwonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88 Milly is 15\nyesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons 5 or 6 about 88 I suppose\nhes 20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 I hope hes not\nthat stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting\ndown in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of\ncourse he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was\nout of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not\na professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson\nthey all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont\nfind many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where\npoetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully\ncoming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point\nthe guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back\nthere again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that\nfor him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly\nbright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young\nstar itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to\ntalk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts\nad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in\ntheir business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like\nto meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young\nthose fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace\nfrom the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or\nsomething and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men\nlike that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely\nlittle statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and\nhis shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and\npoetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his\nlovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth\nif nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and\nwhite he looks with his boyish face I would too in 1/2 a minute even if\nsome of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no\ndanger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I\nsuppose never dream of washing it from 1 years end to the other the\nmost of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure\nitll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age\nIll throw them the 1st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard\ncomes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out\nIll read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew\nwho he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the\nsame and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him\ntill he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and\nmistress publicly too with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he\nbecomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though\n\nno thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no\nnothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because\nI didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a\ncabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place\npulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so\nbarefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar\nway in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a\nbutcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course\nhes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might\nas well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something\nbetter to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its\nbecause they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he\ncouldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the\namount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white\nfor them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with\nthat thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so\nsoft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those\ncornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has\na thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it\ndidnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts\nhis thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be\nyou put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick\nand choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl\nfor their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street\nno but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me\nup no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands\njealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling\nher husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if\nhe did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he\ngoing to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course\nthe man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either\nits the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all\nthose desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can\nI its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with\nhim so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the\nwrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a\nwomans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything\nunnatural where we havent 1 atom of any kind of expression in us all of\nus the same 2 lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the\ndirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita\ntheres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a\nmadman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a\nwoman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make her look young\nno matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the\nfellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking\nwould I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd\nknow me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not\ncare a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of\nthose wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near\nthe Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only\nsent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back\nover and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow\nwith the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me\nup against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do\nthemselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up\nsomewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us\nthe fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course\nit was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and\nwhen I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after\ncoming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his\nwife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten\nagain with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the\nlove of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well\nhe may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he\nknew how
