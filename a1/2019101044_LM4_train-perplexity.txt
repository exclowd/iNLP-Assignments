'•\n\n\n\n\n  18  \n\n\nYes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his\nbreakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the  City Arms  hotel when\nhe used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his\nhighness to make himself interesting for that old faggot MrRiordan\nthat he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing\nall for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was\nactually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all\nher ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and\nearthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God\nhelp the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and\nlownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was\npious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like\nher a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a\nwelleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about MrRiordan here\nand MrRiordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her\ndog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats\nespecially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that\nand waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always\nif ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much\nbetter for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I\nsuppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have\na hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till\nthey throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as\nmuch a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre\nsick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was\nO tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he\nsprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day\nI wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones\nshe could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into\na mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying\non account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more\nlike a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same\nbesides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor\nparing his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I\nwas sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it\nnot to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by\nhis appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her\nso either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was\nreally and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it\nplanning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember\nMenton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he\nnot long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and\nturned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what\nharm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to\nhim mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever\nmet and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle\nin bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in\nwith somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as\nI do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a\nletter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the\npaper as if something told me and he covered it up with the\nblottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably\nthat was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all\nmen get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is\nnow so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old\nfool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I\ncare two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though\nId like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my\nnose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace\npadding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell\nof those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by\ngetting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat\nwithout that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was\ndrinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of\ncourse ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table\non Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing\nmy potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see her aunt if\nyou please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on\nwith that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you\nhave no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters\nbut I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be\nalone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I\nfound in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a\nlittle bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave\nher her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do\nout the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out\nthe dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I\ncouldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar\nand sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the\nplace in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because\nhe couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere\nand the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan\ngave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there\nsteals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb\nto squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he\nhas an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out\nand going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the\nsatisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be\nalways and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking\nboy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id\nconfuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my\ngarters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I\nknow what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging\ndrawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this\nthat and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would\nbecause I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in\nthe jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a\nstranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and\nhe tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he\nis who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it\ntell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine\nIm him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what\nhe never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply\nruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it\ntill he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your\nlips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the\nworld about it people make its only the first time after that its just\nthe ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man\nwithout going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when\nyou feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish\nsome man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in\nhis arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul\nalmost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to\nFather Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and\nI said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my\nchild on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where\nyou sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done\nwith it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put\nit I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he\nwant to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat\nhand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he\nId say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in\nthe box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never\nturn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost\nfor a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them\nId like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense\noff him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre\nmarried hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the\npope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt\nlike his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though\nI laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of\nhis fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it\nwho gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of\ndrink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they\nstick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking\ngreen and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with\nthe opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American\nthat had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do\nto keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took\nthe port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt\nlovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I\npopped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful\nto us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when\nI blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in\nGibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and\ntell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing\nabout nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that\nevening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it\nbrought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to\nchurch mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only\ngrey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I\nlit the lamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that\ntremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or\nwhatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is\nnot so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my\nhours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a\nthick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think\na few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life\nfelt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must\nhave eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with\na big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into\nyou because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious\nlook in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a\ntremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on\nme considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt\nwashed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice\ninvention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if\nsomeone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went\nthrough with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina\nPurefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up\nwith a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a\nsmell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like\na nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the\nlast time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and\nbawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied\ntill they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what\nsupposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was\nmarried Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has\nmore spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting\nJosie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him\noff well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I\nknow they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing\nand sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming\nand then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not\nliking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over\npolitics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a\ncarpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive\nabout everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for\nI knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he\nannoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot\nof mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often\nwanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family\nphysician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was\ncrowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with\nher over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever\nhe asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me\nthe present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that\nfinished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I\nknow how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out\nto see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know\nplenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch\nhim with my veil and gloves on going out 1 kiss then would send them\nall spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of\ncourse would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him\nthat I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love\nhim and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might\nimagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of\na manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it\nout of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and\nwasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the\nnight in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I\nwant to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper\nwith my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too\nmuch the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know\nmore than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie\nwhenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I\nsaid I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash\npossible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick\nwhen hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the\nindifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what\nspoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at\nthat time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was\ntoo beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged\nafterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of\nlaughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling\nout one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great\nhumour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it\nmeant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us\nnot all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault\nshe didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes\ngot like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her\nface beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she\nmust have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment\nshe was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk\nabout him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes\nhe used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him\njust imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might\nmurder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes\nmad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when\nhe comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he\nalways takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and\nnow hes going about in his slippers to look for £ 10000 for a postcard\nU p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff\nto extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what\ncould you make of a man like that Id rather die 20 times over than\nmarry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like\nme to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and\nhe knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that MrMaybrick\nthat poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man\nyes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and\ndo a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating\ndrive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask\nus to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because\nthey cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off\nflypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say\nits from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have\nbeen madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being\nhanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do\nbesides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they\n\ntheyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he\nnoticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C\nwith Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both\nordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his\ntwo old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it\nwas what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed\nbreeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting\nall myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long\none I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got\nafter some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish\ntimes lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to\nMrMarion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the\nturning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea\n2 days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him\nbecause I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he\nmeant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that\nif I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill\nstick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still\nI made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of\na concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to\nmull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my\nstockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another\ntime it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I\ncould find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world\nthat I what did he say I could give 9 points in 10 to Katty Lanner and\nbeat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because\nthe stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in\nthe Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere\nI noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell\nDArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on\nthe choir stairs after I sang Gounods  Ave Maria  what are we waiting\nfor O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown\npart he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was\nalways raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his\nmouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a\nplace like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him\nabout that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there\nand show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it\nor lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an\nidea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got\nme so cheap as he did he was 10 times worse himself anyhow begging me\nto give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming\nalong Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had\nto take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape\nof my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me\nwhen I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject\nof drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced\nthings on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels\neven when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one\nin the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see\nevery atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain\nI saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the\nHarolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the\nZingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking\nslyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they\ncan go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on\nit and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were\nyou where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me\nhis eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it\nwas getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he\npestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he\nsaid my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an\nexcuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time\ntill I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his\nwaistcoat pocket  O Maria Santisima  he did look a big fool dreeping in\nthe rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them\nand beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the\nsunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet\nif I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you\nnever know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it\nif anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers\noutside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him\nfrom doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he\ncircumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do\neverything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting\nall the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the\nbutchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me\nthat letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to\nany woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we\nmet asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw\nI wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was\nalways breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky\nman and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake\ndont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it\nused to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in\nGibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children\nseeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice\na day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman\nwhen he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote\nthe night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it\nsimply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to\nembrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the\nsame time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you\nthink its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the\ndoor of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface\nGoodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after\ndinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me\nprofessor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in\nhis way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out\nyou have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I\nthought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches\nfirst and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was\ntrying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he\nmust have been a bit late because it was 1/4 after 3 when I saw the 2\nDedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch\nhe gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after\nwhen I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty\nwhen I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even\nput on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week\nwere to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers\nanniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms\nat the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new\nbed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next\nroom or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the\nwall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all\nvery well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we\nnever did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes\ngoing where he is besides something always happens with him the time\ngoing to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for\nthe two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with\nthe soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and\nthe waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion\nfor the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two\ngentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was\ntoo hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a\ngood job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd\nhave taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him\nO I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I\nwonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the\ntrain by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots\nof men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly\nbe that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone\nin the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something\nabout him 1 or 2 tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the\nwindow all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what\nwould they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last\nconcert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall\nClarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen\nKearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my\nsinging the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts\nwhen I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him\nmanaged it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to\nsing in the  Stabat Mater  by going around saying he was putting Lead\nKindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out\nhe was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some\nold opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein\nlately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and\nnonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very\nintelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats\nall I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I\nhate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and\nLadysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd\nEast Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and\njust the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was\nlovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty\nhe was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the\nroad he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could\nhave made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of\nthe other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of\ndragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their\nfever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love\nto see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish\ncavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from\nAlgeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham\nbattles on the 15 acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the\nmarch past the 10th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O\nthe lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made\nhis money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me\na nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen\nup there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like\nI had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going\nround with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave\nthis ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the\nknuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or\ntell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go\nand smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money\nand hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I\ncould find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when\nI looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the\nexpression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with\nhis big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat\nalways having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from\nbehind the way MrMastiansky told me her husband made her like the\ndogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so\nquiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the\nway it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish\ntie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly\nwelloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he\nwas like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the\nstoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20\nquid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for\nme on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that\nsponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming\nback that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor\nlooking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first\nnoticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I\nwished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my\nfingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for\nI didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers\nwere hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have\nslipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always\nhanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down\nyour throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a\ngreat compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case\nif its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one\nthing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I\nthink didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them\neither naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she\ndidnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of\nsilkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought\nthem back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one\nchange them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into\nhim and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id\nwant advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips\nhe saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a\ndelightful figure line 11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance\nacross the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill\nhave to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it\nthe last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his\nmoney easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a\ncottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret\nthat he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die\nof the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that\nantifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the\nfashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats\nall he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was\nthe face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like\nnew I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place\nand dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to\nhim Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to\nwash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax\nand violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the\nskin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger\nafter the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry\nhandkerchiefs about 6/- in all sure you cant get on in this world\nwithout style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it\naround I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea\ninto the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues\nitself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all\nthe brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners\n3 whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the\nother the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because\nthey know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every\nday for the 4 years more I have of life up to 35 no Im what am I at all\nIll be 33 in September will I what O well look at that MrGalbraith\nshes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys\non the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down\nto her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham\nstreet 1st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it\nas if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the\nday before we left and that MrLangtry the jersey lily the prince of\nWales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads\nonly for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black\nmans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she 45 there was some funny\nstory about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster\nknife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and\nthe prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing\nlike that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master\nFrancois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her\near because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and\nher a e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that\npretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody\ncan see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that\ntwice I remember when I came to page 50 the part about where she hangs\nhim up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a\nwoman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out\nof her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the\ncrib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have\na child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of\nher side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and\nshe a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar\nthe year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted\nthe tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me\ntoo if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to\nchuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it\nand go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank\nwhere they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day\nof course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with\nhim any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe\nlike father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching\nabout for advertisements when he could have been in MrCuffes still\nonly for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could\nhave got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada\nonce or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly\nMrBloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I\nlost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming\ninto fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no\ngood by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as\nI said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot\nof trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me\naltogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and\ncooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I\nwent by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes\ntake that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles\noff my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my\nbackside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in\nGrafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as\ninsolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were\ngiving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of\nher yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second\ntime he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see\nhim looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for\nme it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mr\nBloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him\nbeing insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled\nI know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely\nsorry and Im sure you were\n\nyes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he\nmade me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one\nanyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep\nthat up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out\nfor him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2\nthe same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up\nthere like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide\nit with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a\nman looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down\nout of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it\nwith a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat\nmarket or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the\nstatue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was\npissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one\nside the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved\nthem theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed\noutside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to\ntry some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was 1 of the 7\nwonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night\ncoming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade\nto make you feel nice and watery I went into 1 of them it was so biting\ncold I couldnt keep it when was that 93 the canal was frozen yes it was\na few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see\nme squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it\nbefore I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not\nafraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the\nwoman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for\na picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the\njob in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee\npalace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes\nonly shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish\nphoto he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her\nand that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some\njawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply\nthe way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of\nthe pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his\nteeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent\nthey fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly\nenough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a\npound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate\nlooking student that stopped in no 28 with the Citrons Penrose nearly\ncaught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to\nmy face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till\nhe got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get\nhim to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker\nthan cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond\neverything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only\ncould remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it\nthe works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an\nhour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant\nI had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those\nmen get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch\nmyself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come\nagain like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when\nhe made me spend the 2nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was\ncoming for about 5 minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him\nafter O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or\nanything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain\nwho knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man\ntheyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice\nabout it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my\neyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue\nbetween my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday\ntwo Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday\n\nfrseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those\nengines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and\nout of them all sides like the end of Loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor\nmen that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in\nthose roasting engines stifling it was today Im glad I burned the half\nof those old Freemans and Photo Bits leaving things like that lying\nabout hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the W\nC I’ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there\nfor the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres\nlast Januarys paper and all those old overcoats I bundled out of the\nhall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and\nrefreshing just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get\nlike Gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on\nblack as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big\ngiant compared with their 3 Rock mountain they think is so great with\nthe red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and\nthe smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time\nweltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend Mr\nStanhope sent me from the B Marche paris what a shame my dearest\nDoggerina she wrote on it she was

than her wogger he was\nawfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to\nstep over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was\ngiven the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them\nexpecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic\nall staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or\njump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious\nold Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the 2\nthings in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the\nwomen were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole\ninsides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all\nmy life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog

on a thread with the one hand we\nwere like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in\nher bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning\nwith the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an\nopportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father\nand Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the\nwindows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like\nall needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at\nmyself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was\nattractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent\nlooking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the\nshadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the\nexcitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been\nnice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me\nthe Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East\nLynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat MrHenry Wood Henry Dunbar by\nthat other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as\nhe see I wasnt without and Lord

when I got up on\nthe sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them\nat night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago\nit seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her\naddress right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were\nalways going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and\nthe boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those\nOfficers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything\nhe was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was\nblowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I\ndid or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a\nGorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage\nmade very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it\ngot as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run\naway mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or\naunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me\nwaiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and\nbooming all over the shop especially the Queens
