after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper	117.08763122558594
the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added <unk> to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be <unk>	202.52099609375

from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce	238.95184326171875
miss bingley was engrossed by mr darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her	235.7646942138672

mr bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer	142.54335021972656
well well said he do not make yourself unhappy	37.4201774597168
are they indeed	19.144269943237305
miss s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings	136.71304321289062
i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at	115.78262329101562
he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room	70.22016143798828

you have a sweet room here mr bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk	93.10673522949219
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of a great opposition of character bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness openness ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied	329.13348388671875
who would have thought it	22.8499755859375
his temptation is not adequate to the risk	51.115665435791016
i do not believe she often sees such at home	41.56978225708008
we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care	150.48143005371094
if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november th by four clock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday night following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day	426.13262939453125
i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable	91.7608642578125
elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley	53.41917419433594
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly replied why should you be surprised my dear eliza do you think it incredible that mr collins should be able to procure any s good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you	338.39410400390625
did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring	112.94495391845703
take whatever you like and get away	49.34268569946289
it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country	88.41773986816406
if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy	71.29449462890625
your s conduct does not suit my feelings	32.99393081665039
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink	43.16527557373047
never since reading s second letter had she entertained a hope of s meaning to marry her	82.35205841064453
obstinate headstrong girl	36.162269592285156
perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease	114.28214263916016
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation	138.18760681152344
to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection	50.65555953979492
you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice	159.5340118408203
yes do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley	75.361328125
your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not and at another word might stay a month	320.4167175292969
he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility	173.0548095703125
from their infancy they have been intended for each other	42.50078582763672
oh yes they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland	113.6376953125
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her s entrance though no request of introduction had been made	80.22434997558594
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way	57.47521209716797
oh	5.7444658279418945
there is not a bit of fish to be got day	42.919189453125
there can be no occasion for your going so soon	38.170692443847656

i never saw such a long chin in my life	35.52458953857422
i hope he will overlook it	22.016687393188477
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage	70.03856658935547
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again	177.671875

i will think no more about him	25.641660690307617
he bore it however with admirable calmness	47.917354583740234
elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it	35.95580291748047
the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months <unk> painful to me	119.39495086669922
you know him too well to doubt the rest	37.99014663696289
my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands you t think	58.02460861206055
who would have thought she could be so thin and small	49.84564208984375
this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he	45.79330825805664
it was in the times and the <unk> i know though it was not put in as it ought to be	90.59383392333984
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to mr darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance mr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained	825.7839965820312
oh	5.7444658279418945
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing young women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life	111.9087905883789
can you come morrow	18.0285587310791
i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together	126.45052337646484
she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them	195.84573364257812
i thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name	52.53066635131836
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness	37.5175666809082
you were mr s first choice	27.50135040283203
when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence	207.72915649414062
to his <unk> engagement with miss de bourgh	30.182231903076172
she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her	82.09220123291016
good heaven	10.426671028137207
i am sorry it went off	22.52336883544922
it soon led to another and mr bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter	108.41825866699219
i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him	54.176963806152344
when tea was over mr hurst reminded his law of the but in vain	64.7392807006836
well he is a very undeserving young and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now	101.29788970947266
her father lifted up his eyes	25.317113876342773
i suspected as much replied elizabeth	29.02962875366211
and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it	67.45895385742188
there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters	154.8678436279297
i was uncomfortable enough	20.360984802246094
had you then persuaded yourself that i should	34.502567291259766
our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money	133.7928924560547
but at least it shews that she was serious in the object of her journey	56.659793853759766
had his own happiness however been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best but her s was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himself	163.2036590576172
if you are a good girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of them	78.21540069580078
she added by far too much	30.04208755493164
but her commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy mr collins and he was very soon obliged to take her s praise into his own hands	126.9979476928711
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say	139.81668090820312
after an affectionate parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr collins and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and his compliments to mr and mr gardiner though unknown	231.12774658203125
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life	49.11239242553711
dear madam cried mr hill in great astonishment t you know there is an express come for master from mr gardiner	102.0667724609375
mr gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself	148.41127014160156
may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study	96.49706268310547
wickham passed all his youth there you know	51.36175537109375
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more like manner	272.1484375
mr darcy is not to be laughed at	27.395750045776367
did it said he did it soon make you think better of me	60.582557678222656
is not this an agreeable surprise	36.75326919555664
that he was not a tempered man had been her firmest opinion	46.962059020996094
but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him	75.8171615600586
what he means to do i am sure i know not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again morrow evening	203.52207946777344
this is a parade cried he which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune	86.35334777832031
and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house	55.59595489501953
instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt but no recollecting herself that could never be	151.3931884765625
regard for my s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr wickham who left the place immediately and mr younge was of course removed from her charge	142.9100341796875
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained	224.79635620117188
when first mr bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son	102.1180648803711
charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say	32.22016525268555
no officer is ever to enter my house again nor even to pass through the village	74.54732513427734
this is my advice	16.45869255065918
mr bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when mr bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was	254.65936279296875
they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister	184.885009765625
so far each recital confirmed the other	57.62517547607422
since her s death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her education	86.47138977050781
you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us	107.95014953613281
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings and mr s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much	125.21505737304688
she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural consequence which the attentions of the officers to whom her s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance	153.08502197265625
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice	46.35735321044922
pemberley was now s home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see	82.13978576660156
she answered him with cold civility	26.152132034301758
bingley is most unaffectedly modest	37.31089782714844
but papa is so disagreeable	20.664596557617188
it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return	88.2028579711914
project gutenberg also has an html version of this file which includes the original illustrations	58.666961669921875
what does mr darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my conversation with colonel forster	74.17912292480469
and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it	50.362300872802734
i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it	84.86263275146484
it cannot be	13.442480087280273
i do not recollect that we did	23.663114547729492
my dear brother replied mr bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for	58.67591094970703
i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind	51.4691162109375
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane	117.9112548828125
mr wickham	11.046615600585938
allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place	202.9430389404297
upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward	49.244117736816406
elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation	97.68766784667969
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph	44.83725357055664
my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not lady catherine	68.0125961303711
s affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to s for him	77.7220687866211
our situation with regard to lady s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast	105.96294403076172
how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library	126.2368392944336
the moment of her release from him was ecstacy	44.9326286315918
however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were	54.701210021972656
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her	86.2917251586914
the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who <unk> it were familiar to them	94.32928466796875
the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke	129.00625610351562
certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it	260.8898620605469
and when you have given your ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also	75.82925415039062
and what arts did he use to separate them	51.21746063232422
he has more to give	22.85915184020996
oh	5.7444658279418945
the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter	191.8284149169922
my dear father i congratulate you	18.60350799560547
but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together	189.43930053710938
cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted	28.61432456970215
it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers	97.0771255493164
invented by bell charlotte street bedford square	42.057193756103516
you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such <unk> as these	80.84474182128906
is this to be endured	22.119487762451172
if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you	80.00260925292969
she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes	155.14764404296875
you can now have nothing farther to say she resentfully answered	60.351531982421875
no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you	65.26114654541016
must it be so	23.45853042602539
in her own past behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin	111.7582778930664
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply	77.95185089111328
the rector of a parish has much to do in the first place he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron	130.52426147460938
only look at her	22.000314712524414
he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if any thing could be made out from them	136.94178771972656
mr collins	9.33775806427002
but his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited	358.82666015625
i have said no such thing	23.427663803100586
we seem to have been designed for each other	32.969852447509766
so near a <unk> to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart	102.532470703125
allowing for the common demands of the game mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy	173.7655487060547
mr s expectations were fully answered	26.348220825195312
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him	110.89917755126953
but are you pleased jane	25.72907257080078
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes	27.673171997070312
yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say mr darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable	276.18359375
from the room they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day	212.87474060058594
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily <unk> seeing him till after the departure of the former	166.632568359375
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them	130.68472290039062
i must find mr gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed i have not an instant to lose	103.23693084716797
impossible mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teazing	74.6525650024414
miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy	74.29679870605469
the party did not supply much conversation	41.3388557434082
another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my night cap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away	239.18565368652344
could there be finer symptoms	29.509342193603516
t think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side	130.1280059814453
when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing farther to wish	61.06394577026367
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast	33.47574234008789
how mr darcy looked therefore she could not tell	40.78166961669922
tis an etiquette i despise said he	33.50902557373047
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty	145.980712890625
he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening	172.73817443847656
every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight	149.6136016845703
perhaps she is full young to be much in company	42.787410736083984
before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise mr bennet instantly answered oh dear certainly i am sure lizzy will be very i am sure she can have no objection come kitty i want you up stairs	184.73973083496094
he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement	113.9902572631836
my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him	58.613677978515625
mr collins had only to change from jane to and it was soon done while mr bennet was stirring the fire	83.9454574584961
it is really too distressing	25.060623168945312
mr collins made his declaration in form	34.29541015625
i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party	88.10000610351562
after welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming is not this nice	134.35989379882812
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry	102.29557800292969
when i consider she added in a yet more agitated voice that i might have prevented it i who knew what he was	118.14248657226562
upon my word well that was very decided that does seem as but however it may all come to nothing you know	110.11856079101562
all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes	47.27781677246094
is not he a charming man	29.083120346069336
you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper	73.89219665527344
in the first place she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr collins had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy together and fourthly that the match might be broken off	154.98873901367188
said he smiling	18.495920181274414
you judge very properly said mr bennet and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy	100.49832916259766
my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not	69.97692108154297
f f project gutenberg volunteers and employees <unk> considerable effort to <unk> do copyright research on <unk> and <unk> public domain works in creating the project tm collection	126.21001434326172
in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of	56.73351287841797
well jane make haste and tell us make haste my love	53.485355377197266
and pray may i ask	25.830036163330078
i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place	105.30950164794922
this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree	55.12934112548828
i cannot see why mr forster should not ask me as well as lydia said she though i am not her particular friend	92.9482650756836
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees	108.48216247558594

do you certainly leave kent on saturday	41.914794921875
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise	155.74154663085938
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written	56.38848114013672
on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor	85.1324691772461
certainly he replied <unk> his lips	33.07150650024414
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of expectation which mr gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing	169.9812469482422
with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms	48.28041458129883
what are you telling miss bennet	25.634248733520508
women fancy admiration means more than it does	50.6451416015625
this is your <unk> resolve	21.606306076049805
but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride	87.0441665649414
had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr darcy the s expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it	238.06155395507812
with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia assisted by s hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn	187.97445678710938
how he lived i know not	31.014904022216797
they were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them	61.419044494628906
a person may be proud without being vain	44.463653564453125
i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it	161.0804443359375
well well i only hope it will last	40.10386276245117
as they went down stairs together charlotte said i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza	72.7066650390625
chapter vi mr s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete	46.64242172241211
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed	144.50564575195312
though i thought it would be very good fun if i was	53.72782897949219
much as i abominate writing i would not give up mr s correspondence for any consideration	67.47102355957031
i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced	38.956993103027344
mr gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and s correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation	133.91001892089844
at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies	94.74888610839844
they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose	74.81542205810547
follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can but these i suppose are precisely what you are without	144.09735107421875
well supposing them to be in london	29.414627075195312
he meant to <unk> his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it	84.6787338256836
i am by no means of opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her	494.0246276855469
of the s sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough	93.8203125
nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning	110.29762268066406
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she been the <unk> was wretched in the thought of what her sister must <unk>	181.50877380371094
and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report	45.1202278137207
i am afraid you do not like your pen	28.282634735107422
this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming	89.97969818115234
i can recal nothing worse	23.75027847290039
she got up and ran out of the room and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to the parlour	94.1423110961914
and what sort of table do they keep	43.71533203125
it was dated from rosings at eight clock in the morning and was as follows be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you	211.919189453125
most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote	66.97283172607422
very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody	180.77577209472656
she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance	161.9114532470703
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected	97.51774597167969
it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do	257.01666259765625
anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the room before the gentlemen came was <unk> and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil	117.12059783935547
the <unk> pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune	73.6196060180664
there can be no doubt of that	27.176332473754883
you <unk> me for coming	27.452468872070312
they were in fact very fine ladies not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it but proud and conceited	136.94369506835938
of whom does jane ever think ill	47.53805160522461
it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began	64.56381225585938
he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever lived	59.96757507324219
she was sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her s refusal must have given him	143.71463012695312
la	8.785078048706055
he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her	58.27751922607422
no no let me <unk> for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr collins in time	107.13824462890625
it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor	74.40081024169922
you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it	67.2740478515625
the vague and unsettled suspicions which <unk> had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her s match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true	260.0067443847656
a great deal more passed at the other table	39.562339782714844
all loveliness and goodness as she is	34.46199035644531
elizabeth shook her head over this letter	32.367671966552734
and then when we came away it was such fun	43.53019332885742
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case	44.21393966674805
i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is s marriage	89.47811126708984
and then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight	70.84459686279297
i believe i have now told you every thing	32.226844787597656
it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends	81.6153335571289
it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours	67.65423583984375
additional terms will be <unk> to the project tm license for all works posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work	122.4706039428711
if i could but see you as happy	39.36315155029297
in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ancles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise	466.5975036621094
and what can he have to say	27.687463760375977
there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste	111.6812744140625
but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt	81.88077545166016
when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least	124.65980529785156
are you quite sure am is not there a little mistake	55.732059478759766
but jane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their s feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so <unk> to receive her and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished	310.0616149902344
mr collins awkward and solemn apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give	154.17315673828125
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited	49.65790557861328
mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it mr bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to purchase	388.7239685058594
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton	57.2509765625
his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr s steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself	183.02655029296875
but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable	57.27305221557617
but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the natured wishes for her doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain	289.7461853027344
i see what you are feeling replied charlotte you must be surprised very much surprised so lately as mr collins was wishing to marry you	111.68286895751953
i cannot think of it without abhorrence	29.417743682861328
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good	41.774566650390625
never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from consequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings	367.5682373046875
mr bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight	49.648101806640625
chapter xiv one morning about a week after s engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the room their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn	217.30677795410156
mr bennet made no answer	16.11640739440918
she would be in s way you know in that part of the house	46.860042572021484
but while he was mortal there must be a triumph	55.338478088378906
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks	160.65306091308594
she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance	109.5433578491211
it soothed but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus attracted by the rest of her family and as she considered that s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before	267.83294677734375
she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class	241.22311401367188
but mr bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish s week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before	168.9960174560547
of course we hope that you will support the project tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project tm name associated with the work	199.5275421142578
she repeated	12.303232192993164
it is too long ago	22.366046905517578
i shall walk to meryton morrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from town	87.19969177246094
his attachment to rosings certainly increases	32.57558822631836
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very <unk> gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances	260.22918701171875
that abominable mr darcy my s opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it	112.93828582763672
as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of enquiring	76.51962280273438
in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great	65.66761779785156
i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me	40.9465446472168
but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came	104.0725326538086
do you talk by rule then while you are dancing	63.313026428222656
on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago	117.16497039794922
the comfort to her of the s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression	66.80168914794922
i should never have said mr collins was settled near her family	48.744483947753906
no i believe not	19.43208885192871
she will be down in a moment i dare say	34.61939239501953
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging	79.22087860107422
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections	42.15488052368164
i hope they will not meet at all	32.072879791259766
elizabeth again and more seriously assured her of its truth	45.9344482421875
you have	12.781697273254395
i should like it beyond any thing	29.322795867919922
there was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake	131.80447387695312
street monday august	37.93584442138672
such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but for to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined	226.5861358642578
what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer	378.9470520019531
he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling	60.50864791870117
lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darcy	128.80018615722656
i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should be deceived again	124.95741271972656
but he is an ugly fellow	36.9918098449707
mr darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them	56.29315948486328
you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound	45.263790130615234
my dear lizzy i wish you joy	20.830665588378906
mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself	27.794387817382812
chapter v i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter	186.15367126464844
they are all for what they can get	36.85852813720703
a little	15.523812294006348
mr bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating any thing and then rising up said to elizabeth miss bennet there seemed to be a <unk> kind of a little <unk> on one side of your lawn	230.67417907714844
chapter xi when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared	266.5068664550781
yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement	49.89192199707031
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the per cents	198.8158416748047
i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted	90.60710144042969
with a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations	131.10585021972656
never sir	17.70817756652832
i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object	166.2200469970703
lizzy said her father i have given him my consent	44.24961853027344
for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn	87.87238311767578
can it be possible that he will marry her	38.407047271728516
this is an evening of wonders indeed	44.87898254394531
he drew a chair near her	31.31303596496582
if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him	65.29911804199219

the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family	40.62150955200195
mr bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters	77.28034210205078
elizabeth did not know what to make of it	32.289710998535156
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mr hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord how tired i am	192.8124542236328
i cannot believe it	14.506349563598633
you may depend on it replied the other for mr nicholls was in meryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true	172.96058654785156
he saw wickham and afterwards <unk> on seeing lydia	51.406131744384766
she replied in the affirmative	20.996850967407227
oh lord	10.566259384155273
but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me these causes must be stated though briefly the situation of your s family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father pardon me it pains me to offend you	1168.9654541015625
you do not look well	19.03992462158203
miss bingley said he has given me credit for more than can be	60.232872009277344
this was not very consoling to mr bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate	118.6340103149414
your uncle is as much surprised as i and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done	118.03324127197266
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends	134.77392578125
on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place	84.20584869384766
i am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone	111.99214935302734
oh lizzy	9.212966918945312
mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain	94.53845977783203
chapter xii as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must <unk> them more	123.17196655273438
with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected	51.0942497253418
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much	56.05783462524414
they are destined for each other by the voice of every <unk> of their <unk> houses and what is to divide them	110.4849624633789
i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly	80.94414520263672
she was overpowered by shame and vexation	28.9930419921875
but you know married women have never much time for writing	55.04751968383789
but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable	39.49275588989258
i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his <unk>	64.82444763183594
the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand	97.34212493896484
mr hurst and her sister allowed it to be but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of	136.46339416503906
there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel s words and these strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london	174.37623596191406
and for this we are to be thankful	35.94921875
i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news	50.905845642089844
we will go round the park every day	36.53591537475586
he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me	86.29491424560547
i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope my dinners are good enough for her	119.320068359375
how odious i should think them	34.52959442138672
from his garden mr collins would have led them round his two meadows but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost turned back and while sir william accompanied him charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of shewing it without her s help	250.9690704345703
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the <unk> family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune	180.12318420410156
is there one among the sex who would not <unk> against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman	110.93091583251953
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour	64.86807250976562
four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister	112.8120346069336
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent	62.65506362915039
in s presence she dared not mention s name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a s distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the natured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone	331.69464111328125
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour	232.8079376220703
mr gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northward than derbyshire	404.4520568847656
those who do not complain are never pitied	60.203495025634766
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene	345.2839050292969
her s <unk> made the sense of what they owed him more painful to s mind and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family	185.19810485839844
he was her dear wickham on every occasion no one was to be put in competition with him	74.57911682128906
cried lydia	10.439520835876465
what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here	73.45474243164062
she is a very looking woman	22.704648971557617
at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself	90.4751205444336
lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now	85.2535629272461
unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was <unk> and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and <unk> to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own	350.1954650878906
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and mr bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them	256.6393127441406
in spite of having been at st s sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look	253.6790313720703
i am sure you must feel it so	25.154346466064453
people do not die of little trifling colds	40.09668731689453
we do not suffer by accident	35.0410041809082
rendered spiritless by the success of all their endeavours he had yielded to his s intreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit	161.92005920410156
his surprise was great	24.237319946289062
mr darcy walked off and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him	59.286190032958984
i had much rather go in the coach	35.05469512939453
mr bennet indeed said little but the ladies were ready enough to talk and mr collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself	121.74310302734375
long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided	69.357421875
and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well	165.1798553466797
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour	160.03591918945312
most willingly	16.76044273376465
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over	42.852657318115234
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you	125.79298400878906
it was a large proportioned room handsomely fitted up	68.46810913085938
indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me	96.88907623291016
a novel	10.869586944580078
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life	123.98628997802734
the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value	66.85887908935547
but i have always observed that they who are natured when children are natured when they grow up and he was always the tempered most hearted boy in the world	117.96646881103516
remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for every s sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin	179.73214721679688
the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr wickham wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to s i can only say that i am sorry the necessity must be and farther apology would be absurd i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment i had often seen him in love before at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william s accidental information that s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage	1413.0430908203125
she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr collins who entered with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let mr collins and me have a little conversation together	265.3157958984375
for s sake say no more of his partners	55.32145309448242
it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express	76.02826690673828
but he paid her not the smallest attention till her s death made her mistress of this fortune	72.38522338867188
mr s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family	106.46868133544922
it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried	45.82697296142578
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn before she told her sister of mr s proposals	90.5770263671875
but so they always are	24.684494018554688
it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire	39.027835845947266
now what have you to say	25.706314086914062
of which we have been <unk> by the same authority	44.294857025146484
it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention	67.83956909179688
if i have i shall be the last person to confess it	46.14756393432617
again she read on	26.918827056884766
it is every way horrible	35.3807373046875
miss bingley i am sure cannot	28.07218360900879
chapter iv when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of mr bingley before expressed to her sister how very much she admired him	128.6687774658203
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball	163.11546325683594
very very much	14.164106369018555
and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had	153.36785888671875
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do	46.9254035949707
how strange this is	22.996444702148438
elizabeth coloured and a little	24.593395233154297
do not imagine me ignorant of their condition	35.90275573730469
mr gardiner whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks mr reynolds either from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister	157.9790802001953
her heart did whisper that he had done it for her	45.595027923583984
elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings	123.6848373413086
yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but that was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance	153.8764190673828
if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it	111.51258850097656
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine	121.49577331542969
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement <unk> the law of the state applicable to this agreement the agreement shall be <unk> to make the <unk> disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law	175.13394165039062
other schemes too came into her head	39.14616775512695
she cried	12.885185241699219
she longed to see mr philips the lucases and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called mr wickham by each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married to mr hill and the two <unk>	207.39968872070312
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on mr s leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help saying oh	209.57583618164062
i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself	35.72168731689453
i am grieved indeed cried darcy shocked	30.815603256225586
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking mr bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield which was fixed for the following tuesday	220.52218627929688
i did not think mr gardiner was so little to be trusted	40.369136810302734
she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mr bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy	163.66261291503906
when at length they arose to take leave mr bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself particularly to mr bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation	283.9313049316406
i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say	58.32278823852539
but nothing can be done i know very well that nothing can be done	51.73589324951172
what money what <unk> what carriages you will have	47.34092712402344
i cannot quite agree with you there	31.330415725708008
it is a long time mr bingley since you went away said mr bennet	48.59993362426758
my dear jane	12.211200714111328
why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did before him	74.0243911743164
her mother <unk> <unk> embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness	215.05532836914062
i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her	80.21324157714844
she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions	45.00996017456055
bingley urged mr s being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians	151.1887969970703
at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here	81.90309143066406
elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no woman walking was her only alternative	132.17355346679688
indeed	8.307234764099121
but at length by s persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that <unk> which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city	369.9183044433594
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged	86.47366333007812
but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure	50.206809997558594
how so	15.32341194152832
i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister	213.39247131347656

kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on	100.9190902709961
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their walk and mr collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and go	365.1443786621094
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy	44.80754470825195
they must be a great loss to your family	30.094552993774414
elizabeth privately added and how much i shall have to conceal	46.52375411987305
the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances	72.3924789428711
chapter xvii s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr darcy and herself	201.24273681640625
is this thought elizabeth meant for me	39.38016128540039
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their s appearance would not allow them to wait in the room and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower	176.53428649902344
exclaimed elizabeth you are too good	37.23126220703125
even elizabeth began to not that bingley was but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away	103.56895446777344
mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off	50.061241149902344
i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is likely to be in this country much longer	79.11060333251953
she could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on	80.06961059570312
their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge	136.58114624023438
indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance	83.25093078613281
that had his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr bingley was incomprehensible	184.41917419433594
all were struck with the s air all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot	343.4250183105469
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs	45.20936965942383
and of this place thought she i might have been mistress	52.06428909301758
you shall hear what she says	24.460567474365234
i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from any one but myself	102.0269546508789
and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and mr long	58.40214920043945
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before	138.64614868164062
she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being mr darcy she was directly retreating	158.5818634033203
every thing however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to s first sketch	74.64732360839844
the good news quickly spread through the house and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood	61.00406265258789
my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point	59.44978332519531
what do you mean hill	16.40088653564453

you are a very strange creature by way of a friend always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers	265.762939453125
i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice	51.78085708618164
i never met with anybody who delighted me so much	42.78312683105469
have all her friends left her	32.836082458496094
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her	46.72191619873047
a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe	116.73213958740234
nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment but sir s good breeding carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy	227.3872528076172
i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me	55.390769958496094
and what is your success	20.78289031982422
that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask	45.930084228515625
forgive the are you quite certain that you can be happy with him	54.68851852416992
by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their s admiration	241.47032165527344
such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret	78.00614166259766
for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to every body	127.12332916259766
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family	111.2790298461914
the picture gallery and two or three of the principal rooms were all that remained to be shewn	73.18508911132812
thoughtlessness want of attention to other s feelings and want of resolution will do the business	78.08248138427734
well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what say you to the day	70.41162109375
she had obtained private intelligence that mr darcy did not wish for cards and mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected	99.68302917480469
mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary	122.28106689453125
after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought considering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation	355.9129638671875
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but mr bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed	132.9871368408203
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent	105.9595718383789
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring <unk> what <unk> felicity really was	110.28240966796875
his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partner in his pleasure	191.31961059570312
mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mr s being quite unable to sit alone	135.47711181640625
pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam	53.42994689941406
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom	102.26541900634766
do you suppose them to be in london	29.68738555908203
mamma do the people here <unk> know i am married day	57.37850570678711
yes all of them i think	32.028167724609375
a thorough determined dislike of a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy	108.27967071533203
i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr s character connections and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state	173.06723022460938
cried his wife impatiently	27.90506362915039
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her	92.11731719970703
jane resolutely kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the she looked she saw mr darcy with him and sat down again by her sister	151.6544952392578
tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss s	171.17303466796875
it was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him as now when all love must be vain	147.54017639160156
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty	131.40834045410156
at last it arrested and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her	132.3406982421875
wholly inattentive to her s feelings lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy calling for every s congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish	215.39889526367188
but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it	110.21839141845703
but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me	52.4903678894043
i like them prodigiously	29.14129066467285
oh	5.7444658279418945
i do not know i hope there was but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult	71.2974624633789
every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites	353.48077392578125
have you never happened to see her there	35.21101379394531
whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr bennet were dead	205.07200622558594
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone	87.89246368408203
people did say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope it is not true	91.67123413085938
elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of mr collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london	402.9598083496094
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way	53.676937103271484
vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already destined to another	123.7449722290039
that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is lessening the honour of my s triumph very sadly	76.09835815429688
mr bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss s witticisms on fine eyes	209.5839385986328
but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground	261.93182373046875
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct	83.33631896972656
her s carriage is regularly ordered for us	41.98146438598633
they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her s tea	46.938743591308594
why should he	21.830875396728516
and so was i you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner	67.8995590209961
i congratulate her	13.972091674804688
morrow fortnight	24.469802856445312
another intreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment	111.01042175292969
the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question	268.63720703125
darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of <unk> them	167.8802032470703
she saw all the glories of the camp its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young and the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once	223.59312438964844
mr hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep	84.69380187988281
my style of writing is very different from yours	45.21334457397461
you provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who <unk> you in writing or by within days of receipt that he does not agree to the terms of the full project tm license	148.25762939453125
lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and mr collins in describing the civility of mr and mr philips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house	319.0558776855469
jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness	57.24344253540039
my father however is partial to mr wickham	31.293685913085938
mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at netherfield	206.94863891601562
but no letter appeared and she was completely <unk>	42.10969161987305
he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy a most intimate confidential friend	77.39763641357422
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of	149.17816162109375
their brother is a pleasant like he is a great friend of s	54.12809371948242
oh	5.7444658279418945
i am glad i bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox	69.25521087646484
but how did he account for it	30.76708984375
yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no <unk> received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister <unk> the admiration of her former lover	196.7071075439453
but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well	57.20197677612305
and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a <unk>	114.23342895507812
please check the project gutenberg web pages for <unk> <unk> <unk> and addresses	58.364418029785156
her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies	143.6695098876953
i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it i must be in town next saturday	106.75283813476562
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me	75.26610565185547
she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine	135.52978515625
but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw mr darcy walk into the room	108.76588439941406
i have written to colonel forster to inform him of our present <unk> and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy <unk> for which i have pledged myself	166.109130859375
he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger	79.28070831298828
after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she <unk> so disgraceful a match	253.0399932861328
a house in town	23.234495162963867
jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs	313.67315673828125
by s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take <unk> with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself	152.7469024658203
he immediately offered to fetch her others all that his library afforded	57.322792053222656
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer mr bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st s	317.4673156738281
and what sort of young lady is she	35.822357177734375
will you do me the honour of reading that letter	41.225563049316406
mr bennet could hardly contain herself	28.21232032775879
mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began	180.02584838867188
we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye	77.68621826171875
her hair so untidy so blowsy	28.684762954711914
are you indeed	14.28260612487793
i quite forgot	16.00267219543457
his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards mr darcy with a very expressive smile	89.29277038574219
will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say how much i like him	122.4266586303711
affectation of candour is common enough one meets it every where	96.10042572021484
i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she	37.79694366455078
he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again	156.67575073242188
may ebook language	35.97026443481445
i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy	35.07209396362305
if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen	73.49791717529297
but she is too much like her brother very very proud as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement	174.97535705566406
she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she hardly knew of what	65.23197937011719
all what all five out at once	43.85090637207031
he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her	103.72808837890625
the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift	100.3358383178711
elizabeth said no but her mind could not acquiesce	41.185462951660156
they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of every thing but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mr gardiner thought of him and mr gardiner would have been highly gratified by her s beginning the subject	211.7241668701172
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense	83.1734390258789
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view	110.82144927978516
is not it so mr bennet	28.3386287689209
he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her	110.87689971923828
take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment	53.0560302734375
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow	127.24830627441406
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without <unk> them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance	185.7913055419922
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton	59.532527923583984
i never saw a more promising inclination	27.444169998168945
i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement	90.78453826904297
she was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet	76.31517028808594
but these are not s feelings she is not acting by design	54.1632194519043
the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her	335.404296875
but if we do not venture somebody else will and after all mr long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself	192.8605194091797
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long	104.14945220947266
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend	55.783199310302734
that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him	113.61650848388672
i am not now to learn replied mr collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time	236.5187530517578
you have liked many a stupider person	35.743343353271484
why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight	73.94490814208984
mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affectionately taking her hand said in reply do not make yourself uneasy my love	112.07160186767578
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection	53.62603759765625
but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is	46.47077560424805
said her aunt	14.89681339263916
elizabeth was delighted	13.430885314941406
i have sent for you on an affair of importance	44.882850646972656
i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it would happen	56.8094367980957
if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him	46.84941101074219
money	11.969569206237793
this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them	151.13912963867188
only think what a miserable summer else we shall have	73.81525421142578
painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be <unk>	88.99059295654297
i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir	45.10297775268555
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here	119.80361938476562
chapter vi the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him	101.85595703125
he is nothing to us you know and i am sure i never want to see him again	55.09672546386719
elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of s name	71.19990539550781
but we considered it we talked of it as impossible	47.333621978759766
well cried her mother it is all very right who should do it but her own uncle	78.60665130615234
what do i not owe you	29.948781967163086
miss s praise occupied the chief of it	35.98430252075195
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mr bingley and talked of mr darcy may be guessed	82.0673599243164
i am not likely to leave kent for some time	39.38241195678711
mr bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness	87.00869750976562
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old	207.34054565429688
the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park her s residence	87.11134338378906
to mr and mr gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself	71.24928283691406
i cannot understand it	17.13825798034668
it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded	139.4800567626953
and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently	49.27520751953125
she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of s neighbours	152.24403381347656
with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well known fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which mr darcy afterwards discharged	267.5309143066406
go my dear cried her mother and shew her ladyship about the different walks	59.37615203857422
i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses	44.13298416137695
whatever he said was said well and whatever he did done gracefully	70.68317413330078
when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother s in town so much in love with her that my law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away	141.070068359375
mr hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves	99.92582702636719
could he expect that her friends would not step forward	43.665245056152344
it is difficult it is distressing one does not know what to think	58.85810852050781
how nicely we are crammed in	28.2297420501709
charlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard	75.55147552490234
it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the <unk> did not answer to that of any of their neighbours	105.58445739746094
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen	156.1188507080078
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants	45.60123825073242
if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor	217.17909240722656
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr s attentions	170.24427795410156
i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable law	77.33173370361328
how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it	79.05754852294922
where where is my uncle	32.132591247558594
i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the <unk>	61.07921600341797
my dear sir replied mr collins i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her s concurrence	162.4840545654297
for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more serious tone that he is improved in essentials	91.55458068847656
not that i shall though she added to herself as she finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to <unk> and <unk> to find it out	153.57704162597656
one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty	173.38619995117188
as she went up stairs to get ready mr bennet followed her saying i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself	144.67630004882812
yes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once	77.08878326416016
such an openness and gentleness in his manner	34.35568618774414
her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it rained hard	72.52477264404297
they were able to love each other even as well as they intended	61.87773895263672
surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement	43.30188751220703
i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth	47.795143127441406
you are over scrupulous surely	27.375164031982422
about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mr younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement	477.75946044921875
another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him if i were you	66.76517486572266
i always said it must be so at last	37.63016128540039
her travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable	92.13983917236328
they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either	63.042137145996094
s sincerely c	18.219045639038086
he had been some time with mr gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning	180.90501403808594
its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn	141.6171875
i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers	104.63933563232422
a vicarage house pride and prejudice	30.553604125976562
such doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly	31.796062469482422
i felt a little a little fearful of my s happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right	119.0092544555664
we were married you know at st s because s lodgings were in that parish	67.35201263427734
they walked on without knowing in what direction	39.80233383178711
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulation	157.8961944580078
the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it	120.87112426757812
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did	175.7830047607422
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mr philips the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter	162.8882293701172
but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a s <unk> again	67.49795532226562
i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn	67.43051147460938
my temper i dare not vouch for it is i believe too little certainly too little for the convenience of the world	79.75080871582031
you have a house in town i conclude	36.940372467041016
his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal	49.6334228515625
my father and maria are to come to me in march added charlotte and i hope you will consent to be of the party	80.9124526977539
some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn would come in the evening	160.24855041503906
the supposition did not pain her	31.693506240844727
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with anxious parade walk up to her s right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister ah	136.66586303710938
but vanity not love has been my folly pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned	203.56582641601562
said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply	74.97490692138672
why does she not come in	29.828372955322266
they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered	151.2398223876953
when mr collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte	113.96305084228516
you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate	36.91164779663086
i shall never forget her appearance this morning	33.5867805480957
to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected	46.865692138671875
i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect	40.75337600708008
thank heaven	15.122293472290039
to miss lydia bennet without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or any thing	113.897216796875
but if i were you i would stand by the nephew	55.32176971435547
he was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by s letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain	324.02581787109375
in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived	56.201141357421875
and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him	81.10712432861328
in three volumes	14.21401596069336
how you must have hated me after that evening	43.363563537597656
but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity	154.13650512695312
it is a nice long walk and mr darcy has never seen the view	54.440277099609375
she enquired into s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as s and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry	287.8902587890625
you may as well call it impertinence at once	41.91339111328125
you are safe from me	19.733938217163086
that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other <unk> which led me on i shall not attempt to deny	100.04703521728516
if	12.57386589050293
i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy	90.79808044433594
he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped	39.843326568603516
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the forte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself	136.70423889160156
their father then went to the library to write and the girls walked into the room	66.72681427001953
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn out like his information	134.8605194091797
as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth	180.63430786132812
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way	102.45071411132812
i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful	86.92798614501953
lady catherine seemed pleased	19.275821685791016
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity	107.2996826171875
