well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done	97.44816589355469
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn out like his information	134.8605194091797

and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an s younger son	115.0943374633789
your humility mr bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof	45.940589904785156
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of mr collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings	118.1886978149414
with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself	77.46080780029297
my dearest sister now be be serious	33.692222595214844

if as i conclude will be the case you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement	161.29981994628906
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her	106.92984008789062
it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried	45.82697296142578
chapter vii two days after mr s return as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons when they approached her she said to miss bennet i beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask	375.9770202636719
she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge	73.6263427734375
with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it	94.1573257446289
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it	228.1138458251953

for though your accusations were founded formed on mistaken <unk> my behaviour to you at the time had merited the <unk> reproof	110.02142333984375
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for that she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right	177.6630859375
as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many s happiness were in his guardianship how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow how much of good or evil must be done by him	176.67369079589844
the dejection was almost universal	39.28141403198242
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole	178.08607482910156

miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance	73.4905014038086
how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy for now they do appear wholly undeserved	140.3123779296875
how can you be smiling so lizzy	33.19398880004883
elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and <unk> heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him	181.80319213867188

on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor	85.1324691772461
thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women	196.43270874023438
i do not think it is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not	65.06771850585938

your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to you	91.54444122314453

it is not mr bingley said her husband it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life	82.46573638916016
there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters	154.8678436279297

poor charlotte it was melancholy to leave her to such society but she had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion	165.89389038085938

chapter ii elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning	155.89898681640625
it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the s family it would be an unpleasant thing	137.62539672851562
they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds	48.065895080566406
i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible	88.14329528808594
elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the <unk> change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the <unk> of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her s incredulity and <unk> him to the match	368.1714782714844

he was well but so much engaged with mr darcy that they scarcely ever saw him	67.47270965576172
mr bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters	77.28034210205078
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had been already written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon s degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well	288.8182067871094
fatigued as she had been by the s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance	162.42068481445312
darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right	37.67625045776367
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his s marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible	171.9884490966797
the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt	328.4778137207031
you are quite a visit in my debt mr bingley she added for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned	145.62673950195312

when they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished them a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next year and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both	175.8870391845703
i owe all that i know of it to another not to you	56.17465591430664
darcy after enquiring of her how mr and mr gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely any thing	98.49298095703125
that is as it happens	23.088943481445312

chapter xi when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent	160.16375732421875
that tall proud man	38.64598083496094
indeed you are mistaken	16.6202392578125
mr darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire paid his compliments with his usual reserve to mr collins and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend met her with every appearance of composure	171.37252807617188
he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room	90.24710845947266
she is a great deal too ill to be moved	33.70878601074219
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due	101.0058822631836
having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mr collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another	160.23593139648438
she complained bitterly of all this to her husband	40.632450103759766
then pray speak aloud	25.26250648498535
never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting	114.99761962890625
but my dearest love tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it morrow	78.39523315429688
make haste and come down this moment	36.37059020996094
his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother	162.5320281982422
i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses	342.6136169433594
are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine	101.97374725341797
mr hurst and her sister allowed it to be but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of	136.46339416503906
not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said jane i congratulate you	158.3703155517578
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy	41.98112487792969
cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment	30.530717849731445
mr darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them	56.29315948486328
girls can i do any thing for you in meryton	39.98191452026367
no indeed i did not i knew nothing at all of lady s connections	63.55043029785156
or in other words you are determined to have him	47.684085845947266
that had his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr bingley was incomprehensible	184.41917419433594
mr gardiner whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks mr reynolds either from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister	157.9790802001953
i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows	51.1556510925293
how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library	126.2368392944336
with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal	194.57554626464844
it soothed but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus attracted by the rest of her family and as she considered that s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before	267.83294677734375
it is impossible for me to be impartial	25.916606903076172
yet he is such a man	23.913057327270508
but i have other provocations	22.75524139404297
in s imagination a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness	59.48851013183594
it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling	53.480525970458984
who could about such a nasty little freckled thing	74.54685974121094
pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam	53.42994689941406
the good news quickly spread through the house and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood	61.00406265258789
but vanity not love has been my folly pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned	203.56582641601562
and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a <unk>	114.23342895507812
they will then join his regiment unless they are first invited to longbourn and i understand from mr gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the <unk>	143.039794921875
had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place	62.71619415283203
but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the natured wishes for her doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain	289.7461853027344
he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane	91.26518249511719
your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has too much truth	87.16211700439453
mr gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head	132.3755645751953
my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these	53.933780670166016
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference s lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her	150.74386596679688
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance	44.84444808959961
if i may so express it he has a right to be proud	58.763404846191406
i have not been in the habit of <unk> disappointment	34.42875289916992
the next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter of an s te with mr bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his house and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to she could not positively but she did not know of any prepossession her eldest daughter she must just she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged	518.47314453125
was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield	75.94868469238281
you may have drawn him in	26.698402404785156
poor little lizzy	20.536903381347656
thoughtless thoughtless lydia	39.928619384765625
i need not explain myself farther and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable	288.5699462890625
they will join me early morrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you mr bingley and his sisters	123.39065551757812
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here	119.80361938476562
my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request	67.83942413330078
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose	125.6807632446289
i am afraid you will be angry	19.696945190429688
as mr gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and her children should go to london at the same time that mr bennet came from it	122.97169494628906
said elizabeth	8.749918937683105
having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy	53.98995590209961
you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas	46.10763931274414
i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection	86.86600494384766
but at length by s persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that <unk> which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city	369.9183044433594
the children have been wanting me this half hour	40.937049865722656
he brought it with him for us to see	40.57302474975586
a young man such as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent	162.49237060546875
only think	20.716373443603516
i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly	80.94414520263672
but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my s absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized	126.88973999023438
wretched wretched mistake	33.580589294433594
they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when s quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room	229.45425415039062
since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head	97.25082397460938
but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art	87.94503021240234
i must not decide on my own performance	32.22571563720703
his debts are to be paid <unk> i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased	130.91921997070312
whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable	41.506046295166016
all young ladies accomplished	23.39280891418457
well but now for my news	34.320030212402344
she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success	82.05882263183594
mr s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before	204.1299285888672
she dreaded seeing wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible	70.7591323852539
i had no notion but he would go a <unk> or something or other and not <unk> us with his company	92.57125854492188
her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice had fortune permitted it	109.81718444824219
i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship	57.25421142578125
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission jane certainly could not come back	66.82109069824219
bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening mr s <unk> was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter	125.0317611694336
there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed	74.91158294677734
i do not know of any other designs that he had formed	40.327999114990234
i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing	40.1800537109375
we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will approve	82.87162017822266
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home	41.2509765625
that is because you have the right disposition	46.64680480957031
if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me	138.6341552734375
with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic	64.51766204833984
this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of seven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it	143.55801391601562
i cannot think of it without abhorrence	29.417743682861328
what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been <unk> and gratefully received	135.70912170410156
she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself some shelves in the closets up stairs	345.5848083496094
she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley	55.65967559814453
i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two	66.31221008300781
nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece	139.0726318359375
we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there twice how much i shall have to tell	99.0860595703125
on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago	117.16497039794922
i thought i should have broke my heart	34.32460403442383
mr collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day	151.3584747314453
the ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse	194.57958984375
she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks	64.52198028564453
chapter xvi as no objection was made to the young s engagement with their aunt and all mr s scruples of leaving mr and mr bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the room that mr wickham had accepted their s invitation and was then in the house	327.6083679199219
said miss bingley will she be as tall as i am	40.73682403564453
all that is required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your life one hundred pounds per annum	306.91241455078125
he has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one	74.15933990478516
i leave it to yourself to determine said mr bennet	48.18394470214844
mr gardiner who was several years younger than mr bennet and mr philips was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces	138.36770629882812
you refuse then to oblige me	32.73273849487305
these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by every thing	258.40948486328125
i certainly shall not	20.16689682006836
she had obtained private intelligence that mr darcy did not wish for cards and mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected	99.68302917480469
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way	102.45071411132812
much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you	54.759246826171875
without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows	154.25381469726562
i do not recollect that we did	23.663114547729492
you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself	68.79086303710938
is not general incivility the very essence of love	46.54937744140625
they must all go to brighton	28.97040367126465
no lizzy that is what i do not choose	35.462337493896484
you will be a very happy woman	23.959758758544922
what are we to do	21.639970779418945
upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration	92.52977752685547
oh	5.7444658279418945
bingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the principal object	45.126678466796875
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible	183.66079711914062
they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt	98.62903594970703
jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out oh papa what news	234.29568481445312
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now established only as a tenant miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table nor was mr hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her	320.1083679199219
how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family	220.3734130859375
well my dear said mr bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley and under your orders	187.8761749267578
with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected	51.0942497253418
colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object	32.240379333496094
she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you	111.89717102050781
it would <unk> me indeed to see you again the <unk> of miss s pretended regard	80.47135925292969
there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every body too who is likely to know	95.96602630615234
i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor mother	48.63920593261719
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences	120.15812683105469
has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage	49.08375930786133
it was only said lately george wickham <unk>	41.340824127197266
she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome	90.42654418945312
had the late mr darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his s uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life	143.10971069335938
my dear you flatter me	18.139297485351562
when my eyes were opened to his real character oh	51.6273078918457
contact the foundation as set forth in section below	49.28172302246094
miss bingley i am sure cannot	28.07218360900879
her favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt beyond the reach of lady s curiosity	218.0516357421875
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her s	47.34264373779297
my temper would perhaps be called resentful my good opinion once lost is lost for ever	81.73390197753906
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her	92.11731719970703
no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it	102.5744857788086
they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her s tea	46.938743591308594
who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole so immediately after your arrival	111.00643920898438
let us hope for better things	35.69368362426758
smiles <unk> the face of mr bennet as the carriage drove up to the door her husband looked impenetrably grave her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy	123.72761535644531
elizabeth hoped she had <unk> him but he soon afterwards said i was surprised to see darcy in town last month	102.76668548583984
he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business	85.90129852294922
yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say mr darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable	276.18359375
she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two	106.82737731933594
but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand	71.8055419921875
miss s praise occupied the chief of it	35.98430252075195
the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of splendor and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings	282.03326416015625
he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months	216.68177795410156
the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt	38.96426010131836
i thought i should have died	24.832548141479492
the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it mr bingley	48.60190963745117
mr gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both	128.02389526367188
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being	128.0532989501953
it is evident that you belong to the first circles	34.60700988769531
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject mr bennet coolly observed from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country	146.1555633544922
i do not believe a word of it my dear	29.740957260131836
her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all the others	56.51447296142578
cried mr bennet shaking her head then she is better off than many girls	63.535865783691406
this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their s proposal and it was settled that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better	152.7991943359375
they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens	67.91627502441406
about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged	111.13428497314453
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation	38.29305648803711
you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken	122.31627655029297
after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr darcy drawing near elizabeth said to do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel	273.1539611816406
it was to be such a secret	22.440324783325195
when they ascended the steps to the hall s alarm was every moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calm s courage did not fail her	126.69170379638672
he shall be mercenary and she shall be foolish	39.59574890136719
one must speak a little you know	36.27253723144531
lydia my love ring the bell	35.27949905395508
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained	73.36433410644531
perhaps she is full young to be much in company	42.787410736083984
and have you answered the letter	31.358030319213867
to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes of mr s heart were entertained	107.50757598876953
were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion	126.0980224609375
what do i not owe you	29.948781967163086
but of every other neglect i can believe him capable	44.786903381347656
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned	63.02729034423828
and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it	50.362300872802734
no never	16.615154266357422
with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia assisted by s hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn	187.97445678710938
this is wholly unexpected	25.331605911254883
jane looked a little <unk> than usual but more <unk> than elizabeth had expected	60.64982604980469
when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of it of which officers mr wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions mr gardiner rendered suspicious by s warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both	197.82383728027344
oh	5.7444658279418945
had you then persuaded yourself that i should	34.502567291259766
they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other	86.40806579589844
i know no harm of her	18.467575073242188
my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentioned	44.14344024658203
nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant	86.6360855102539
there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming	91.80164337158203
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way	57.47521209716797
which do you mean	17.51450538635254
though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it	119.29991912841797
in point of composition said mary his letter does not seem defective	56.16555404663086
nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight	54.94141387939453
mr hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the room	124.9765396118164
and so did mr forster	23.17746353149414
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again	75.3101577758789
i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper	97.51721954345703
my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed	42.260284423828125
your profusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather	141.81773376464844
occupied in observing mr s attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend	143.09165954589844
i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier	45.11769104003906
bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased	61.66483688354492
my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect	81.00474548339844
you promised me to insist upon her marrying him	40.45902633666992
you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment	103.9810562133789
not so hasty if you please	31.762866973876953
it was a subject which they could not mention before me	42.103397369384766
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and mr bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them	256.6393127441406
i wish it may	19.77666473388672
if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning	206.8000030517578
it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire	94.33605194091797
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected	52.00278854370117
the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his writing or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each	200.65013122558594
here comes hill	22.140588760375977
if i could but see you as happy	39.36315155029297
miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her	121.42781829833984
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very little except in a low voice to mr jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes	240.15011596679688
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of s happiness and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its frequently recurring	179.0099334716797
<unk> michael s hart was the <unk> of the project tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone	100.20439910888672
the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual	131.9456787109375
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of expectation which mr gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing	169.9812469482422
all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading	127.35950469970703
change of scene might be of and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything	118.55819702148438
forgive the are you quite certain that you can be happy with him	54.68851852416992
charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the room where mr bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family	264.4950866699219
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one	178.27638244628906
speak to lizzy about it yourself	37.807979583740234
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy	32.86603546142578
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more it now first struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors	321.3910827636719
i am so grieved for him	19.395917892456055
my motive for cautioning you is as follows	47.73728561401367
in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost	182.6853790283203
it would be such a delicious scheme and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all	66.27098083496094
what is your own opinion	16.97271156311035
she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour	102.86903381347656
with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it	73.0488052368164
i hope she will turn out well	32.13697052001953
after a slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud	60.62644577026367
mr darcy had been at her s wedding	27.663436889648438
why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks	68.58480834960938
she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty	108.11595153808594
cried jane	10.027274131774902
i had not believed it possible	27.694059371948242
teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind	72.36922454833984
lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention	51.988712310791016
you mentioned two instances	25.965862274169922
i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together	119.52174377441406
that is a question which i hardly know how to answer	39.922794342041016
there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies	58.56611251831055
we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home	74.21189880371094
march was to take elizabeth to hunsford	36.493316650390625
you tear them to pieces	23.686588287353516
there are a lot of things you can do with project tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to project tm electronic works	132.0166015625
this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for s absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make attention forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham	445.5953369140625
this was very amiable but s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of mr s addresses by engaging them towards herself	202.74632263183594
mr darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a <unk> and who probably never looked at you in his life	99.1410140991211
he is as fine a fellow said mr bennet as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw	85.3321304321289
it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth	42.69068145751953
i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer	40.42890930175781
they are destined for each other by the voice of every <unk> of their <unk> houses and what is to divide them	110.4849624633789
the girls stared at their father	29.95869255065918
mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off	50.061241149902344
but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves	55.25912857055664
i am grieved indeed cried darcy shocked	30.815603256225586
this room was my late s favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then	81.29676818847656
to yield to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you	53.33905029296875
oh	5.7444658279418945
as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmly i have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable	102.29369354248047
oh	5.7444658279418945
and is this all	23.09584617614746
she was gone directly	16.392473220825195
she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so	45.8552131652832
whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to you	96.29458618164062
she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr darcy and herself	199.3866424560547
on the very last day of the s remaining in meryton he dined with others of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she mentioned colonel s and mr s having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former	326.49835205078125
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over marks nothing bad at heart	146.8545379638672
she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty	163.591796875
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth	39.90217971801758
he added that mr bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon	94.48451232910156
she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them	195.84573364257812
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene	345.2839050292969
when a woman has five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty	101.1297607421875
i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him	76.8102798461914
she declared her resolution	19.913944244384766
in three volumes	14.21401596069336
lydia my love though you are the youngest i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball	85.31967163085938
there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome	104.93296813964844
i am the happiest creature in the world	22.00072479248047
his s request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative	157.57774353027344
if <unk> believe me i did not once put my <unk> out of doors though i was there a fortnight	95.5515365600586
mr bennet was privileged to whisper it to mr philips and she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton	108.99763488769531
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr darcy then was	97.57167053222656
that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me before	57.20193862915039
and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman am	57.39257049560547
let me advise you then my dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence	167.4670867919922
my uncle	11.915165901184082
to such perseverance in wilful deception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female	296.06280517578125
having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the agitations of former partiality entirely so	141.93087768554688
it was over at last however	27.32961082458496
his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing	76.10155487060547
it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours	101.24855041503906
no nothing at all	19.495655059814453
in the project gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for project tm and future generations	82.82233428955078
how is half such a sum to be repaid	34.69594192504883
every thing nourishes what is strong already	41.69384765625
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society	90.88349914550781
well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next	45.640594482421875
how i wanted you	20.147478103637695
she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend	91.37985229492188
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when mr jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de s being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light	156.9326171875
mr darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together	51.50559616088867
the next was in these words	28.50420570373535
that his two sisters and mr darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable	205.59873962402344
his belief of her s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice	184.77633666992188
that he has neither integrity nor honour	44.328346252441406
the <unk> wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other	162.3232879638672
such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned	213.5467071533203
but my dear lydia i t at all like your going such a way off	66.54216766357422
if the second copy is also defective you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the <unk>	146.38546752929688
regard for my s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr wickham who left the place immediately and mr younge was of course removed from her charge	142.9100341796875
it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go	103.87469482421875
if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen	73.49791717529297
i cannot talk of books in a room my head is always full of something else	79.76661682128906
believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire	182.31822204589844
he was my godfather and excessively attached to me	40.49382019042969
the possibility of meeting mr darcy while viewing the place instantly occurred	54.233097076416016
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library	139.42254638671875
but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning the part which i acted is now to be explained his uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london we accordingly and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice i described and enforced them earnestly but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your s indifference	1290.49169921875
but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself	62.380245208740234
a little	15.523812294006348
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room	54.953285217285156
that is not very likely our authority was too good	46.70122528076172
i hope not so	19.6195068359375
start	10.60279655456543
my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace	114.61376190185547
he studies too much for words of four syllables do not you darcy	85.99276733398438
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydia	271.429443359375
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement	36.79814147949219
i do not think we were speaking at all	32.195255279541016
i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude	53.257835388183594
let me mend it for you	22.117721557617188
mr s eyes sparkled a gentleman and a stranger	42.16923141479492
this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors	196.8447723388672
i do not mind his not talking to mr long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza	90.05924224853516
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return	240.0443115234375
believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections	105.16761016845703
where does discretion end and avarice begin	78.1451187133789
has she any family	25.81937026977539
you shall have it in few words	35.9589729309082
adieu to disappointment and spleen	27.615741729736328
it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world	292.75897216796875
but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters	69.17825317382812
how was that possible	21.10637855529785
she dared not relate the other half of mr s letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend	94.50250244140625
s being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their <unk> in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body and had so many favourites	257.83746337890625
she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley	32.233848571777344
elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last	151.89154052734375
not that i am afraid of myself but i dread other s remarks	61.61576461791992
you are <unk> lizzy	18.39024543762207
their first subject was her sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to her minute enquiries that though jane always struggled to support her spirits there were periods of dejection	146.06275939941406
s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars	99.36904907226562
elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to treat in such a manner the son the friend the favourite of his father	117.32958221435547
it is from my cousin mr collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases	110.06085968017578
from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that work of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry	364.46148681640625
both changed colour one looked white the other red	51.768898010253906
with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield	84.78797912597656
she longed to see mr philips the lucases and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called mr wickham by each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married to mr hill and the two <unk>	207.39968872070312
but jane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their s feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so <unk> to receive her and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished	310.0616149902344
they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others	290.3454284667969
you must not blame my aunt	24.875049591064453
i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his <unk>	64.82444763183594
complied with	14.51663589477539
charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say	32.22016525268555
no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard	58.23394012451172
he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence	47.06310272216797
they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride	202.33859252929688
we can all begin a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement	128.67532348632812
can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this	50.42435836791992
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr s visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner	120.03331756591797
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr s pleasure in the invitation to the officers and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smile i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here	439.695556640625
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world	115.7037124633789
you certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome	76.05705261230469
in short i will do my best	31.637256622314453
who could have done less for her	34.675106048583984
she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be deliberated on the probability of each but with little success	100.06298828125
to learn more about the project gutenberg literary archive foundation and how your efforts and donations can help see <unk> and and the foundation information page at <url> section	154.81175231933594
how is such a man to be worked on	38.16353225708008
let wickham be your man	30.216541290283203
in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either	65.50372314453125
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible i know it cannot be long	75.24933624267578
there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire	37.584388732910156
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence	138.0312957763672
but how are you	16.996992111206055
when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music	78.70491790771484
it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that s character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was	115.49385833740234
he was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by s letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain	324.02581787109375
so much the better	17.862825393676758
he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere	176.59896850585938
well any friend of mr s will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him	106.22040557861328
you know him too well to doubt the rest	37.99014663696289
we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way	327.23834228515625
i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary	68.05878448486328
at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner	182.32052612304688
perfectly i thank you	21.507795333862305
for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more serious tone that he is improved in essentials	91.55458068847656
the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit near elizabeth began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her <unk>	214.22329711914062
it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it	43.889217376708984
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father	147.3035125732422
mr s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer and mr s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could	100.96855163574219
i am only ashamed of his asking so little	31.97113800048828
an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for us	67.67689514160156
he smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things	45.45473098754883
of having another daughter married to mr collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure	111.73042297363281
she has known him only a fortnight	31.699779510498047
she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door	145.541259765625
all this was acknowledged to mr gardiner and after relating the circumstances she thus went on i am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil	300.0822448730469
cried elizabeth	8.131646156311035
i am perfectly satisfied	16.53384780883789
what money what <unk> what carriages you will have	47.34092712402344
it is what every body says	23.995311737060547
mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them	110.77569580078125
but what is that to me	27.218460083007812
cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted	28.61432456970215
the hall the room and all its furniture were examined and praised and his commendation of every thing would have touched mr s heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property	157.9158172607422

at length the parsonage was discernible	25.5816593170166
well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him	59.32843780517578
they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence	99.10848236083984
but papa is so disagreeable	20.664596557617188
i do not know when i have been more shocked said she	45.68746566772461
yes to the last	18.495088577270508
oh	5.7444658279418945
u s laws alone <unk> our small <unk>	44.77809143066406
but will they make you happy	32.63911056518555
they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve	78.45071411132812
oh	5.7444658279418945
elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more	47.65415954589844
did charlotte dine with you	25.950822830200195
the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them	78.2718276977539
in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man	73.78217315673828
lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room	54.17867660522461
unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds	73.39950561523438
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her s in sending it	89.72813415527344
she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine	135.52978515625
their table was superlatively stupid	26.975948333740234
in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself	82.65141296386719
the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chuses to be seen	126.53380584716797
how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning mr darcy she cried i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter	156.05589294433594
the families who had been in town for the winter came back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose	89.08769989013672
if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach	222.99508666992188
who is to fight wickham and make him marry her if he comes away	69.7497787475586
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way	53.676937103271484
they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his s offers of refreshment	190.9198760986328
on this subject what can you have to say	35.70132064819336
i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge	57.18765640258789
i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an tempered man	56.29497528076172
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling	99.41561126708984
hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort	139.24659729003906
said elizabeth to herself you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this	110.00465393066406
chapter xi mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet	173.8968505859375
nay said elizabeth this is not fair	29.3641357421875
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable	58.431522369384766
their reception from mr bennet to whom they then turned was not quite so cordial	65.69116973876953
his countenance rather gained in <unk> and he scarcely opened his lips	71.69236755371094
he then told her of s delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend	313.47772216796875
you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them mr bingley might like you the best of the party	167.61990356445312
on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married	120.5714340209961
it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express	76.02826690673828
she could think of nothing but of mr wickham and of what he had told her all the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent	175.27430725097656
she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation	207.56173706054688
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer mentioned and while mr darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on s person behaviour and dress	168.9638671875
yes	7.694679260253906
but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event	76.56483459472656
the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you	57.59606170654297
well much good may it do them	41.76739501953125
my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my s nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself	86.614501953125
i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his s inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy	163.76132202148438
i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely	95.91967010498047
that abominable mr darcy my s opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it	112.93828582763672
mr darcy walked off and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him	59.286190032958984
i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference	116.36698913574219
my visit was not long as caroline and mr hurst were going out	62.18910598754883
but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered no no stay where you are you are charmingly d and appear to uncommon advantage	181.39907836914062
elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation	165.43667602539062
it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first	118.18092346191406
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all	73.20541381835938
cried elizabeth darting from her seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant and mr darcy appeared	205.7144317626953
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through house	53.21696472167969
her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while mr and mr gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party	154.66102600097656
pride prejudice chapter i miss s letter arrived and put an end to doubt	77.80911254882812
more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed	81.71432495117188
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park	116.69265747070312
i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from any one but myself	102.0269546508789
jane shook her head	16.885784149169922
oh well	12.530462265014648
it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year	63.74614334106445
you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite	183.32102966308594
oh	5.7444658279418945
had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr darcy the s expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it	238.06155395507812
did it said he did it soon make you think better of me	60.582557678222656
in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam	72.76304626464844
what say you mary	27.73872947692871
the evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth	137.03955078125
perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers	125.53546142578125
elizabeth was forced to go	16.737762451171875
i enquired after their brother of course	35.582984924316406
she is a very good kind of girl i believe	30.808626174926758
but no letter appeared and she was completely <unk>	42.10969161987305
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most like appearance walking with an officer on the other side of the way	158.54458618164062
bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time	148.67552185058594
his father was an excellent man said mr gardiner	32.9116325378418
what can be the meaning of this	24.55447769165039
in his present behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her	202.50946044921875
she cried	12.885185241699219
they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long	98.49601745605469
i thought it my duty to give the <unk> intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned	186.96583557128906
that is all very proper and civil i am sure said mr bennet and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman	73.83757019042969
will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties	237.94293212890625
and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it	67.45895385742188
she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means	51.45425796508789
what a fine thing for our girls	34.045082092285156
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her	164.39016723632812
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was	33.467201232910156
jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs	313.67315673828125
his doing so drew her notice	33.494117736816406
lady catherine sir william and mr and mr collins sat down to quadrille and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino the two girls had the honour of assisting mr jenkinson to make up her party	136.3924560546875
now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits	139.067626953125
it was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it	69.4146499633789
oh	5.7444658279418945
i am trying to make it out	22.37171173095703
let me do it without farther loss of time	42.21320343017578
already arisen	23.37331771850586
though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage	106.9896011352539
mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr s house and then made their bows in spite of miss s pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of mr throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation	190.1222686767578
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone	47.87957000732422
at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies	94.74888610839844
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers	42.32845687866211
his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy	111.13290405273438
his sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion	68.75955200195312
but what said she after a pause can have been his motive what can have induced him to behave so cruelly	80.95632934570312
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulation	157.8961944580078
now kitty you may cough as much as you chuse said mr bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife	106.52273559570312
but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant	82.99726104736328
first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room	115.92155456542969
every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed <unk> away there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time	147.72076416015625
oh	5.7444658279418945
yes indeed cried mr bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood	66.22500610351562
yes there can for mine is totally different will you hear it	64.11959838867188
four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister	112.8120346069336
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness	37.5175666809082
oh	5.7444658279418945
very well	10.523648262023926
i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun	48.684242248535156
as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that	94.74301147460938
her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation	108.53693389892578
their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor i nor any body can ever forget	80.79299926757812
let me hear from you very soon	28.01837921142578
i did hear too that there was a time when making was not so <unk> to you as it seems to be at present that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been <unk> accordingly	196.3682403564453
you never see a fault in any body	36.86906051635742
bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable	49.25142288208008
let me hear what it is	20.960227966308594
but you forget mama said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mr long has promised to introduce him	87.60966491699219
i do not deserve it	17.38620948791504
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley	69.55022430419922
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted	176.58966064453125
to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia	79.77094268798828
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family	162.64767456054688
chapter ii mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley	53.104705810546875
i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle	113.1618881225586
the pause was to s feelings dreadful	39.01641082763672
matlock pride and prejudice	26.711166381835938
chapter xviii till elizabeth entered the room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her	193.5667724609375
the world has been deceived in that respect and i am happy to say there will be some little money even when all his debts are discharged to settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune	157.7283935546875
he did every thing best in the world and she was sure he would <unk> more birds on the first of <unk> than any body else in the country	92.13936614990234
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfield	150.164306640625
a short pause followed this speech and mr hurst began again	55.17937469482422
yes said elizabeth mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him	78.95720672607422
any other inconsistencies with modern <unk> have been left as printed	58.662776947021484
the room in which the ladies sat was backwards	37.50809097290039
from the room they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day	212.87474060058594
has she been presented	19.29393768310547
mr bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar	57.975425720214844
and that i suppose is one of your sisters	33.591880798339844
she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice	201.71600341796875
oh	5.7444658279418945
and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly <unk> to the family	159.61378479003906
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the forte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself	136.70423889160156
and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently	49.27520751953125
you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms	87.59385681152344
do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent	96.928955078125
chapter xiv one morning about a week after s engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the room their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn	217.30677795410156
as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was ordered and after some contrivance the whole party with all their boxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of s and s purchases were seated in it	248.11253356933594
i rather wonder now at your knowing any	53.64299774169922
i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected	87.86354064941406
for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path	68.93942260742188
i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses	73.90290069580078
we had better not mention it	28.059053421020508
give my love to colonel forster i hope you will drink to our good journey	62.014373779296875
perhaps we might be deceived	24.372337341308594
but mr bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice	176.11734008789062
no no you shall not deceive me	29.809003829956055
cried wickham with a look which did not escape her	41.782310485839844
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her s words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darcy who sat opposite to them	246.71449279785156
i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long	82.2623291015625
chapter xxii the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins	97.33375549316406
and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty	88.90961456298828
to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had <unk> but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of <unk> and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley	346.1684265136719
upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward	49.244117736816406
you must and shall be married by a special licence	44.26860046386719
she has one only daughter the heiress of rosings and of very extensive property	68.56509399414062
in as short a time as mr s long speeches would allow every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness	321.9262390136719
mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character	140.42739868164062
it is because he will not give himself the trouble	41.39102554321289
i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very and indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir s in his regimentals	295.48297119140625
day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter a report which highly incensed mr bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood	232.70504760742188
you must send john with the young ladies mr collins	51.53557586669922
that is right you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine	82.8762435913086
your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you	56.82521057128906
i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got mr bingley if she could	71.56126403808594
at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him	47.86241912841797
we can all plague and punish one another	48.79582595825195
elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked	34.71030807495117
could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes	87.85787963867188
you take delight in vexing me	31.312414169311523
she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown	94.61961364746094
mr bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think any thing less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand year	280.0136413574219
he must be an oddity i think said she	37.56052017211914
her s <unk> made the sense of what they owed him more painful to s mind and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family	185.19810485839844
after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball	137.9239501953125
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without <unk> them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance	185.7913055419922
because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it	81.58662414550781
my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now	63.25265121459961
lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and mr collins in describing the civility of mr and mr philips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house	319.0558776855469
i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception	51.49786376953125
i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness	92.55725860595703
i hope they will not meet at all	32.072879791259766
had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure	309.36505126953125
mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last mr collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility	111.91510009765625
mr bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house	107.88329315185547
you have done all this	20.271547317504883
but while he was mortal there must be a triumph	55.338478088378906
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner	63.67380905151367
at once to insist upon having such a report universally <unk>	52.958824157714844
project gutenberg is a registered trademark and may not be used if you charge for the ebooks unless you receive <unk> permission	91.9673843383789
allowing for the common demands of the game mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy	173.7655487060547
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring <unk> what <unk> felicity really was	110.28240966796875
i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands	83.63186645507812
when the gentlemen rose to go away mr bennet was <unk> of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time	114.05659484863281
and they are really to be married	25.018123626708984
they attacked him in various ways with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas	260.82171630859375
as soon as jane had read mr s hope of s being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its exuberance	109.17405700683594
i have not been used to submit to any s whims	37.3785400390625
i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship	58.593997955322266
she had ventured only one glance at darcy	38.37459945678711
in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation	116.28201293945312
indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary	55.55809783935547
this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas	67.29996490478516
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with charlotte and the kind attentions she had received must make her feel the obliged	138.21119689941406
i shall now know how to act	27.34466552734375
oh	5.7444658279418945
before any answer could arrive from mr collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge	162.49136352539062
a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible	104.31769561767578
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence	58.16134262084961
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection	53.62603759765625
some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn would come in the evening	160.24855041503906
she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural consequence which the attentions of the officers to whom her s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance	153.08502197265625
where is your sister	22.089920043945312
and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth	87.46356201171875
in s presence she dared not mention s name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a s distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the natured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone	331.69464111328125
and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report	45.1202278137207
and what can he have to say	27.687463760375977
i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them	158.26307678222656
mr collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed	48.7574462890625
thought elizabeth	16.227867126464844
you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have <unk> me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice	123.60023498535156
she will not be able to help calling	30.265317916870117
he is not at all liked in hertfordshire	32.38139343261719
but against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered	173.53921508789062
my mind was more agreeably engaged	28.87196922302246
that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home	84.36587524414062
they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit	97.8954086303711
e gardiner mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of s removal from the shire as clearly as mr gardiner could do	102.97017669677734
nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of humility	68.7943115234375
the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity	77.32427215576172
and this is always the way with him she added whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment	103.654296875
if you do not charge anything for copies of this ebook complying with the rules is very easy	94.17292785644531
her air was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank	100.06195068359375
chapter vi mr s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete	46.64242172241211
mr bingley arrived	15.3776273727417
and in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by s relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount	176.539306640625
it is wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride has often been his best friend	109.75467681884766
the path just admitted three	40.92240524291992
the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again	102.1557846069336
no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it	79.1522216796875
tis an etiquette i despise said he	33.50902557373047
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn before she told her sister of mr s proposals	90.5770263671875
my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal	36.695335388183594
i do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way	231.5028076171875
my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room	52.04689025878906
he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her	57.79103469848633
your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds	179.6569061279297
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her	86.580322265625
what will wickham say	24.90983772277832
he was angry	14.149269104003906
my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again	47.69416809082031
jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he need not stay	70.54093933105469
this is quite shocking he deserves to be publicly disgraced	42.8488883972168
yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it	105.67649841308594
the project gutenberg ebook pride and prejudice by jane austen edited by r w robert chapman this ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever	147.7151336669922
my fingers wait your orders	32.74921417236328
and what did she say	22.353511810302734
and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace	214.6983642578125
she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us	192.3692626953125
she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him she is lost for ever	86.27298736572266
why did she come	21.06029510498047
where where is my uncle	32.132591247558594
and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty	46.530635833740234
in the former were many good paintings but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss s in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible	215.44578552246094
lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her s letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was <unk> over	128.7820587158203
i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing	70.6488265991211
had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd	121.24935150146484
i am sure my sisters must all envy me	41.161964416503906
oh lord	10.566259384155273
will you come and see me	28.3866024017334
you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy	36.54521179199219
only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage	104.1629409790039
yes replied wickham his estate there is a noble one	55.427574157714844
there was now employment for the whole party for though they could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected them round the table	219.47117614746094
last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary	146.34786987304688
he was silent	13.667659759521484
but that is nothing to us	21.540952682495117
do not you want to know who has taken it	38.4307746887207
they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either	63.042137145996094
with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed	290.1256103515625
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily <unk> seeing him till after the departure of the former	166.632568359375
the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention	128.02230834960938
mr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation c	77.69178009033203
good gracious	9.208251953125
i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she	37.79694366455078
i have a high respect for your nerves	37.189456939697266
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed	58.337162017822266
if it was not for the entail i should not mind it	46.91384506225586
mr gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and s correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation	133.91001892089844
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them	52.28720474243164
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance	180.66506958007812
if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield said mr bennet to her husband and all the others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for	132.40255737304688
after an affectionate parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr collins and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and his compliments to mr and mr gardiner though unknown	231.12774658203125
we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world a sense of very great ill usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is	192.64984130859375
it was some days however before they received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till day almost a week after the s arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening	256.56414794921875
he could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest <unk> of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st s with very decent composure	200.56593322753906
and you saw him frequently	29.241058349609375
i mend pens remarkably well	46.85000991821289
certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger	118.72239685058594
you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday are you much acquainted with mr darcy	140.31747436523438
not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive	108.05223083496094
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust how humiliating is this discovery yet how just a humiliation had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind	196.56356811523438
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it	104.35289764404297
their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves	80.50105285644531
mr bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself instead of a ceremonious card	163.69960021972656
after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first and saying i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley	118.14851379394531
it is difficult it is distressing one does not know what to think	58.85810852050781
lizzy to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family	86.5290756225586
they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants	92.08314514160156
that is very strange	17.320993423461914
he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names	51.64785385131836
follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can but these i suppose are precisely what you are without	144.09735107421875
at length in a voice of forced calmness he said and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting	127.56404113769531
from their infancy they have been intended for each other	42.50078582763672
i cannot quite agree with you there	31.330415725708008
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of such affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine	190.0516357421875
from herself to from jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr s explanation there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again	147.3822021484375
but mr gardiner could not be seen and mr darcy found on further enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning	138.078125
not that i think charlotte so very but then she is our particular friend	67.53440856933594
how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year	58.013450622558594
and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house	94.96160888671875
he has been here this half hour and master has had a letter	61.55894470214844
it was first broken by mr annesley a genteel looking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others and between her and mr gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on	271.4053039550781
i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve	67.42363739013672
on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile	89.04339599609375
she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave	149.69314575195312
i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say	58.32278823852539
her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies	143.6695098876953
she talked to elizabeth again and again coaxed and threatened her by turns	82.47286224365234
when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other	88.8593978881836
her report was highly favourable	24.399023056030273
he readily assured her of his again expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away	201.74700927734375
these parties were acceptable to all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not	155.82923889160156
she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses	329.5883483886719
elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives	124.65550231933594
is not he a charming man	29.083120346069336
they entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent	100.29252624511719
you quite mistook mr darcy	23.878860473632812
would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe	44.911354064941406
she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when	73.99018859863281
upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself	182.91470336914062
well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him morrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth	174.92477416992188
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking	62.52306365966797
at present i will say nothing about it	31.911705017089844
my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much	71.65284729003906
how strange	13.921510696411133
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her	46.72191619873047
caroline did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receive in the mean time	112.46110534667969
multiple superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets example	55.77589416503906
they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose	74.81542205810547
and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her	47.786720275878906
we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said mr gardiner but perhaps to the lakes	93.7645263671875
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it were required	111.3439712524414
but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself	86.64350891113281
she had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid disagreeable fellows	248.63185119628906
on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared	290.4466247558594
kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in s last letter she had prepared her for such a step	123.46176147460938
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings and mr s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much	125.21505737304688
mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began	180.02584838867188
shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to <unk> her	75.87781524658203
how can it affect them	22.037090301513672
he drew a chair near her	31.31303596496582
they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went <unk> on with him alone	161.1673583984375
miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place	60.610755920410156
i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one but i always speak what i think	74.3812255859375
mr gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of any thing else	205.96726989746094
let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance	70.70957946777344
were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express	75.54222106933594
elizabeth went away with her head full of him	35.48442077636719
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield	190.34475708007812
i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is s marriage	89.47811126708984
her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter	207.58773803710938
for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to every body	127.12332916259766
my dear jane i am in such a flutter that i am sure i t write so i will dictate and you write for me	85.30227661132812
his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature	77.33243560791016
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable	171.90145874023438
there was certainly at this moment in s mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance	143.40443420410156
mr collins then returned to elizabeth	23.069015502929688
chapter iv elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere	300.2237548828125
and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had	153.36785888671875
i will think no more about him	25.641660690307617
and this said she is the end of all his s anxious circumspection	52.310890197753906
it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in	63.7059440612793
i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear	85.11383056640625
as she pronounced these words mr darcy changed colour but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued	141.59133911132812
pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us	83.96920776367188
be assured my dear sir that mr collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove	181.24539184570312
while these born notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of s feelings was every moment increasing	118.34767150878906
her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas <unk> to invite him to sit by herself	85.91316223144531
their manners are not equal to his	32.8144416809082
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks	160.65306091308594
he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so <unk>	96.10334777832031
the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport	227.261962890625
no thanks to his gallantry for that	43.41542053222656
i must speak to hill this moment	33.39637756347656
see paragraph c below	32.72831344604492
much as i abominate writing i would not give up mr s correspondence for any consideration	67.47102355957031
chapter ix elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while mr collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor	147.31329345703125
well if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better	81.20394897460938
his debts to be discharged and something still to remain	44.632694244384766
it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture	57.660133361816406
when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for	114.4637680053711
easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be important	163.70774841308594
in understanding darcy was the superior	42.92106628417969
he could number the fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump	91.27487182617188
who are your uncles and <unk>	31.68415641784668
mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do	100.37289428710938
she became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it	64.12601470947266
then turning to mr bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon	62.55109786987305
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character	38.54343795776367
miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton	134.8330078125
and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry	115.90213012695312
they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance	292.11163330078125
long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided	69.357421875
i have sent for you on an affair of importance	44.882850646972656
she answered with equal indifference and brevity and the other said no more	71.74571228027344
and we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there	125.371337890625
you are safe from me	19.733938217163086
family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this	87.29977416992188
it was the last of the s stay in meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace	62.32898712158203
and so you like this s sisters too do you	46.320045471191406
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration the shocking rudeness of mr darcy	158.42373657226562
oh	5.7444658279418945
they are young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain	127.71317291259766
what a good joke it will be	28.629240036010742
the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do	136.46875
he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world	129.3441925048828
you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us	57.48773956298828
the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke	129.00625610351562
if you received the work on a physical medium you must return the medium with your written explanation	77.73719787597656
elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little	276.40020751953125
miss bennet i am shocked and astonished	29.925174713134766
but depend upon it mr collins she added that lizzy shall be brought to reason	58.387611389160156
with many compliments to them and much gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matter to an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for mr bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed good lord	250.9728240966797
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after	144.54010009765625
very very much	14.164106369018555
from what can it proceed	25.8885498046875
maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire	80.68891906738281
besides there was truth in his looks	36.75818634033203
i hate such false friends	26.4482479095459
he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we the sort of preference which was often given me	110.4459457397461
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do	156.13711547851562
elizabeth made no answer	14.769086837768555
no no nonsense lizzy i desire you will stay where you are	56.19911193847656
if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of s unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair	186.51206970214844
at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward	66.5118408203125
i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield	45.56879806518555
they had therefore many acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of s father five years before it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring	223.7659149169922
he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room	70.22016143798828
she could not bear such suspense and hastily <unk> a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended	173.60919189453125
my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts	64.41799926757812
her heart did whisper that he had done it for her	45.595027923583984
a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation	129.02256774902344
sure he will not leave london before he has found them	56.85047149658203
i believe she and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object	76.02017974853516
after tea mr bennet retired to the library as was his custom and mary went up stairs to her instrument	83.74429321289062
then after a short silence he continued lizzy i bear you no will for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shews some greatness of mind	157.0679473876953
as they drove to mr s door jane was at a room window watching their arrival when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever	236.73350524902344
chapter xviii the first week of their return was soon gone	43.236244201660156
she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him	80.29075622558594
very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours	213.2885284423828
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life	49.11239242553711
but who was your mother	26.460391998291016
a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern	44.985809326171875
i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish	159.10922241210938
under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief	63.3182487487793
he was full of joy and attention	31.641727447509766
was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and from all the others when they sat down to table	92.03205871582031
you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not conceal your age	70.28594207763672
elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough	97.826904296875
yes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once	77.08878326416016
but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties	75.61698150634766
they will take care not to outrun their income	56.103702545166016
she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she hardly knew of what	65.23197937011719
if i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficient	56.981163024902344
elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of mr collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london	402.9598083496094
mr collins was eloquent in her praise	25.935218811035156
those who do not complain are never pitied	60.203495025634766
the note was immediately dispatched and its contents as quickly complied with	58.616729736328125
the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park her s residence	87.11134338378906
i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit	156.6698760986328
but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair	141.23605346679688
not the slightest	17.78374481201172
i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least	61.56085205078125
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl oh	67.63421630859375
they walked on without knowing in what direction	39.80233383178711
he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling	60.50864791870117
ten thousand pounds	13.755010604858398
i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject we may compare our different opinions	147.62640380859375
and though he exclaimed at the <unk> she found that it had been pretty much the case	67.11203002929688
i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town	67.68204498291016
from the former	17.269481658935547
elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of s name	71.19990539550781
upon my word said mr gardiner i begin to be of your s opinion	51.425506591796875
he was on one side of her mother	27.41671371459961
do not distress me by the idea	32.461116790771484
he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton	127.64234924316406
let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor	45.76393508911133
cried jane what do you mean sir	26.292682647705078
the <unk> pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune	73.6196060180664
how shall we punish him for such a speech	39.04819107055664
she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with	132.624755859375
it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration	63.98996353149414
i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me	52.34571075439453
ah	7.231865882873535
the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely	82.7982406616211
you thought me then <unk> of every proper feeling i am sure you did	59.74897384643555
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him	110.89917755126953
very nonsensical to come at all	25.177400588989258
in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings	147.705810546875
when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses	68.83858489990234
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a manoeuvre of mr bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family	211.47723388671875
how well it sounds	19.560701370239258
catherine spirited irritable and completely under s guidance had been always affronted by their advice and lydia willed and careless would scarcely give them a hearing	115.84953308105469
what are men to rocks and mountains	33.76721954345703
he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into every s family	116.7135238647461
i must beg therefore to be <unk> no farther on the subject	49.38076400756836
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance	93.00392150878906
that he was not a tempered man had been her firmest opinion	46.962059020996094
shall we ask your cousin the reason of this	44.82403564453125
or had you intended any more serious consequence	46.590518951416016
and pray what sort of guardians do you make	36.931941986083984
this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley day	82.94718170166016
i was ready to die of laughter	36.88578796386719
c and if she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them	73.44122314453125
chapter xv on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary	134.54180908203125
care of him yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care	96.37828826904297
why does she not come in	29.828372955322266
i see what you are feeling replied charlotte you must be surprised very much surprised so lately as mr collins was wishing to marry you	111.68286895751953
but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle	53.74028015136719
mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at netherfield	206.94863891601562
but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it	110.21839141845703
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes	27.673171997070312
well monday morning came and i was in such a <unk>	59.11751937866211
i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses	44.13298416137695
he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily	137.98680114746094
she shall hear my opinion	26.046300888061523
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr s name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged	168.80223083496094
a great deal more passed at the other table	39.562339782714844
oh brother how kind you are	41.02659225463867
but that expression of violently in is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea	95.69831085205078
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr darcy looked up	65.84638214111328
no no let me <unk> for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr collins in time	107.13824462890625
it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor	74.40081024169922
nobody can tell what i suffer but it is always so	47.99282455444336
mr collins readily assented and a book was produced but on beholding it for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read novels kitty stared at him and lydia exclaimed other books were produced and after some deliberation he chose s sermons	371.0540466308594
in that case he would return no more	33.75302505493164
his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and that if he marry <unk> his wife may teach him	139.5740509033203
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow	127.24830627441406
i never heard that it was	20.180797576904297
s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth	41.8834114074707
the party did not supply much conversation	41.3388557434082
it is not quite a week since they left brighton	35.69993591308594
this mr younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town	133.9883270263672
but make a virtue of it by all means	42.89630126953125
it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever	144.1954345703125
it would have suited me in every respect	33.40135192871094
the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion	50.415138244628906
as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family	215.30735778808594
have not you always hated him	26.486478805541992
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without calling her attention	102.39928436279297
while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her	258.36126708984375
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink	43.16527557373047
such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret	78.00614166259766
said he smiling	18.495920181274414
every thing however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to s first sketch	74.64732360839844
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour	84.67626190185547
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose	90.06951141357422
they then went away	18.858556747436523
his plan did not vary on seeing them miss s lovely face confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority and for the first evening she was his settled choice	163.70401000976562
what news	15.818913459777832
is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the horses	69.51345825195312
good god	11.406303405761719
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day	214.7803192138672
their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of s extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them	238.86622619628906
mr darcy you see is the man	30.201738357543945
it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first	47.875823974609375
it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey	246.9208526611328
but really i know not what to say	36.801963806152344
mr darcy may hug himself	21.21413230895996
he has some friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves	54.7827033996582
pemberley was now s home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see	82.13978576660156
what should not you mind	27.64251136779785
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour	64.86807250976562
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand	147.15516662597656
a thorough determined dislike of a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy	108.27967071533203
elizabeth shook her head over this letter	32.367671966552734
and that said mr reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures is my and very like him	97.11518096923828
i hope you have destroyed the letter	38.83909225463867
my dear dear lydia how merry we shall be together when we meet	65.74112701416016
said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i am the youngest m the tallest	64.74632263183594
i am very very sorry	14.602088928222656
elizabeth again and more seriously assured her of its truth	45.9344482421875
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay	112.95619201660156
yes there is nothing in that	24.19859504699707
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of	149.17816162109375
how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him we must forget it ourselves	96.2187728881836
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night	64.13385772705078
yes sir i know i am	29.028745651245117
after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer	259.516357421875
but jane could think with certainty on only one point that mr bingley if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair became public	143.99769592285156
after a short pause her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me	60.14511489868164
it was a large proportioned room handsomely fitted up	68.46810913085938
her reflections were in general satisfactory	30.21422576904297
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling	34.28548049926758
i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire	71.97655487060547
my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way	80.3975830078125
the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter and concluded with her s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country	195.28099060058594
and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road	54.42639923095703
his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards mr darcy with a very expressive smile	89.29277038574219
but it was not to be	16.14815330505371
i am not to be <unk> into anything so wholly unreasonable	43.40399169921875
my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken	71.38056182861328
but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other	178.44650268554688
she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to s	60.51881790161133
he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her	110.87689971923828
but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a s <unk> again	67.49795532226562
you give me fresh life and vigour	37.80976867675781
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above	88.63927459716797
it may do very well for the others replied mr bingley but i am sure it will be too much for kitty	73.15766143798828
yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office	163.71778869628906
jane i take your place now and you must go lower because i am a married woman	76.07144165039062
miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy	74.29679870605469
i know we dine with four and twenty families	43.50443649291992
all that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road	72.3342514038086
lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way	104.48249816894531
the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane and till the morrow their going was deferred	158.5355224609375
there is but such a quantity of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting about pretty much	165.5435333251953
my poor father	14.656131744384766
the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas	70.68268585205078
<unk> it kitty	23.1324520111084
you must not suspect me	26.243511199951172
when i consider she added in a yet more agitated voice that i might have prevented it i who knew what he was	118.14248657226562
he had rather hoped that all his s views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear	100.71977996826172
not at all	15.199553489685059
mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother	34.695430755615234
she was sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her s refusal must have given him	143.71463012695312
you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her	147.63128662109375
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written	56.38848114013672
did not you	15.347498893737793
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight	56.519004821777344
the effect was immediate	19.217313766479492
with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and <unk> <unk>	127.50359344482422
when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane	140.8494110107422
and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment	101.90827941894531
i cannot find out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl	107.92361450195312
these are conditions which considering every thing i had no hesitation in complying with as far as i thought myself privileged for you	92.2936019897461
mary and kitty thank heaven	35.51880645751953
mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary	122.28106689453125
he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected about her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of mr and mr s happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too	397.81292724609375
till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose him	56.34629440307617
mr darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister	145.78553771972656
miss bingley was engrossed by mr darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her	235.7646942138672
who attended to you	22.29067611694336
she enquired after his sister but could do no more	46.480682373046875
but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit	82.30433654785156
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject	63.36817932128906
with a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to any one but myself	174.10311889648438
this was not very consoling to mr bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate	118.6340103149414
they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life	185.3611602783203
yes but intricate characters are the most amusing	50.735595703125
at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance	79.6924819946289
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from s own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr collins too why should he have it more than anybody else	172.65357971191406
they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister	184.885009765625
la	8.785078048706055
she told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in any thing ridiculous	135.7388916015625
most people start at our web site which has the <unk> <unk> search <unk>	100.25916290283203
this must be the grossest falsehood	26.626270294189453
in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better	139.13938903808594
but now suppose as much as you chuse give a loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err	160.88748168945312
i see the imprudence of it oh	33.24229049682617
the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances	72.3924789428711
what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here	59.34467697143555
in the first place she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr collins had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy together and fourthly that the match might be broken off	154.98873901367188
she had gained her point and had time to consider of it	54.83858108520508
i pity though i cannot help blaming her	38.49723434448242
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection	100.468994140625
no no	15.52526569366455
but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour	103.905517578125
mr s schemes for this day were <unk>	34.658721923828125
your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct i am sure	57.24556350708008
mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun	63.587039947509766
have you never happened to see her there	35.21101379394531
i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement	90.78453826904297
the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away	51.660640716552734
one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty	173.38619995117188
but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent	62.15354537963867
a thousand things may arise in six months	44.447776794433594
she had always felt that s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage	207.72976684570312
at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain	163.9242706298828
she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down	59.60897445678711
that lady i suppose is your mother	33.67734909057617
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited	49.65790557861328
it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected	69.68955993652344
she looks sickly and cross yes she will do for him very well	59.052947998046875
it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it	71.68209075927734
i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire	136.93357849121094
oh	5.7444658279418945
his judgment could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable	149.10838317871094
but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation	90.06890869140625
miss bennet do you know who i am	35.410789489746094
certainly said elizabeth though <unk> with curiosity we will ask you no questions	73.91979217529297
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments	95.36678314208984
he is a sweet tempered amiable charming man	34.80377960205078
i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it would happen	56.8094367980957
while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enough i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements	138.9364013671875
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me	41.08015441894531
but her commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy mr collins and he was very soon obliged to take her s praise into his own hands	126.9979476928711
their fortune on both sides is splendid	40.71860885620117
lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly	210.3251495361328
within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be always within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day	250.38247680664062
he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked in an hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there	129.084716796875
i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable	136.27259826660156
are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy	46.97089767456055
miss s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings	136.71304321289062
she began at length to recover to <unk> about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself	103.29206848144531
astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her	35.33499526977539
s c	9.10502815246582
lord	9.11855411529541
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their walk and mr collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and go	365.1443786621094
said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must be complied with	54.535282135009766
the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance	120.85342407226562
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend	55.783199310302734
do any thing rather than marry without affection	49.53288269042969
the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions	195.1255340576172
vol ii london	19.13364601135254
i have sir	15.685577392578125
but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most	71.96748352050781
she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished	86.5434341430664
let me never see either one or the other again	46.18140411376953
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help	129.1090545654297
but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is founded	65.09552764892578
among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous	93.23092651367188
kitty and me were to spend the day there and mr forster promised to have a little dance in the evening by the bye mr forster and me are such friends and so she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did	260.9840087890625
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect	94.5570068359375
i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well i assure you	46.30326843261719
i am not romantic you know	32.79217529296875
he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers	174.9471435546875
you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such <unk> as these	80.84474182128906
i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her s what you have learnt about mr wickham	91.80631256103516
but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes	169.6197509765625
her astonishment at his at his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first <unk> his altered behaviour in derbyshire	144.80923461914062
to pemberley therefore they were to go	28.674087524414062
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for s salutation	195.59519958496094
oh	5.7444658279418945
the gentlemen did approach and when mr wickham walked into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration	171.1660919189453
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and the improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them and he found in mr philips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could	419.0577697753906
i will not tell you what it is	25.458520889282227
my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him	58.613677978515625
her father contented with laughing at them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters and her mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil	163.9798126220703
elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them	158.823974609375
she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such fun here what do you think has happened this morning mr collins has made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him	238.6761016845703
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham	65.80902862548828
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more <unk> and less <unk> than the other had ever seen him	149.988525390625
but where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation	67.85037994384766
the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation	116.410888671875
elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case	59.27536392211914
but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me	52.4903678894043
this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married	53.67144775390625
i was uncomfortable enough	20.360984802246094
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the table and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game	169.32656860351562
they will ruin your happiness	26.051509857177734
how strange must it appear to him	33.50222396850586
cried elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves	29.41069984436035
as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth	180.63430786132812
i would go and see her if i could have the carriage	48.55549240112305
and his sisters are charming women	26.67632484436035
but i must write no more	24.49887466430664
the evening passed quietly <unk> by any thing extraordinary	51.220035552978516
she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mr hurst and miss bingley	61.72582244873047
when this was done she had a less active part to play	57.92324447631836
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball	163.11546325683594
you know not what you are about	27.21552848815918
they were all astonished and mr bennet who could by no means wish for so speedy a return immediately said but is there not danger of lady s disapprobation here my good sir you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness	226.0570526123047
consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her s incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it before they did	149.37484741210938
her affections had been continually fluctuating but never without an object	54.29166793823242
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her	35.03960418701172
you may depend upon my not mentioning it	38.152565002441406
how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day	78.1075210571289
their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge	136.58114624023438
you know i have	18.891870498657227
but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly	82.00567626953125
allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety	214.75180053710938
such was miss s scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon	153.4897918701172
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain	84.71070861816406
and have you heard from him often	37.29188537597656
perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said elizabeth	52.40987777709961
oh yes	8.854702949523926
indeed jane you ought to believe me no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection	91.46359252929688
by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary	261.9659729003906
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their s where his regret and vexation and the concern of every body was well talked over to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed	184.94688415527344
your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us	92.65510559082031
as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce	161.1377716064453
he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true	120.77009582519531
mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required	101.91659545898438
single my dear to be sure	29.08827018737793
bingley is most unaffectedly modest	37.31089782714844
are you indeed	14.28260612487793
f <unk> you agree to <unk> and hold the foundation the trademark owner any <unk> or <unk> of the foundation anyone providing copies of project tm electronic works in accordance with this agreement and any volunteers associated with the <unk> <unk> and distribution of project tm electronic works <unk> from all liability costs and expenses including legal fees that arise directly or <unk> from any of the following which you do or cause to occur	290.24407958984375
that is to say you had given your permission	41.62419891357422
i can no longer help thanking you for your <unk> kindness to my poor sister	60.32270050048828
not like the wild young men days who think of nothing but themselves	81.89715576171875
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable but elizabeth less sighted perhaps in his case than in s did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence	197.19386291503906
he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty	87.30326843261719
special rules set forth in the general terms of use part of this license apply to copying and distributing project tm electronic works to protect the project tm concept and trademark	152.64407348632812
his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by	137.31834411621094
will you tell me how long you have loved him	38.18527603149414
that is the place to get husbands	26.526063919067383
never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her	53.040740966796875
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of s regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it	114.8016586303711
chapter iii not all that mr bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley	140.29298400878906
you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a <unk> is denied me because you have always so much	115.69498443603516
elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation	77.20074462890625
it is of all subjects my delight	34.08828353881836
another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my night cap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away	239.18565368652344
forgive me and if you persist in indifference do not make me your confidante	59.214473724365234
but she is nothing to me now	27.28829002380371
she was not of so <unk> a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of s example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less <unk>	150.9941864013672
mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my s active superintendance and when immediately before my s death mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself	238.0821075439453
such doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly	31.796062469482422
but the gentlemen will have mr s chaise to go to meryton and the hursts have no horses to theirs	110.4095230102539
and various were the subjects which occupied them lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter mr bennet was doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who sat some way below her and on the other retailing them all to the younger miss lucases and lydia in a voice rather louder than any other s was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her	508.5244140625
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness	90.869140625
come as soon as you can on the receipt of this	44.118797302246094
thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper <unk>	70.6386947631836
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery	55.20855712890625
mr s best comfort was that mr bingley must be down again in the summer	70.93887329101562
it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it	79.81861114501953
for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well	69.19480895996094
mr long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips	84.60395050048828
not handsome enough to dance with	29.360034942626953
but self though it would intrude could not engross her	78.42842864990234
and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him	81.10712432861328
mr collins and charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party	121.25930786132812
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy	38.27305603027344
the officers will find women better worth their notice	50.67083740234375
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again and weakened her disgust of mr collins	67.23338317871094
a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it	151.34608459472656
elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased	63.489524841308594
lady s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts	70.20618438720703
if indeed it should be so	28.398805618286133
the visit was returned in due form	34.74446105957031
she could have added a young man too like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contented herself with and one too who had probably been his own companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner	219.77357482910156
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me	75.26610565185547
accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer	209.8675994873047
but it was a hope shortly checked by other <unk> and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham	235.9635772705078
you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last	84.31653594970703
pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe	126.84928894042969
it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor	113.11771392822266
and do you like her	21.25970458984375
and so is it quite certain he is coming	42.8546142578125
she was overpowered by shame and vexation	28.9930419921875
elizabeth was surprised but said not a word	30.56647491455078
who do you mean my dear	23.96202278137207
he had never had the slightest suspicion	31.800304412841797
my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them	51.080142974853516
i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice	90.1478042602539
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice	46.35735321044922
elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it	219.43934631347656
jane now came up	19.222543716430664
having now a good house and very sufficient income he intended to marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view as he meant to chuse one of the daughters if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report	229.4597625732422
that you were gone into the army and she was afraid not turned out well	57.25476837158203
but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me	66.99990844726562
and pray may i ask	25.830036163330078
for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr s but you shall do as you chuse	71.83240509033203
generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself	44.79329299926758
his manners are very different from his s	41.669464111328125
s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of it till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante	183.52899169921875
but these are not s feelings she is not acting by design	54.1632194519043
he had not been long seated before he complimented mr bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage	271.3677978515625
she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind	58.85344696044922
and how impossible in others	31.872364044189453
if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there	161.83364868164062
lizzy said her father i have given him my consent	44.24961853027344
elizabeth did all she could to <unk> him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley	402.43896484375
he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a s recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often and after observing that he was a very like man asked her how she had liked him	200.5670166015625
the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident	35.32951354980469
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together	79.18512725830078
elizabeth was not surprised at it as jane had written the direction remarkably ill	58.906532287597656
her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully	213.50308227539062
pride and prejudice author	20.974170684814453
it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before	154.77891540527344
certainly not	14.756681442260742
take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one	53.21282958984375
next to being married a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then	97.11973571777344
well and what news does it bring	41.03825759887695
bingley was punctual to his <unk> and he and mr bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on	84.34004974365234
i did not expect such a compliment	24.320669174194336
by time however the dose had been enough and mr bennet was glad to take his guest into the room again and when tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies	149.95428466796875
dear sir the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance there mr bennet	361.6683654785156
her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of mr s indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too little she might have fancied too much	224.8099822998047
it must be my s doings	32.310794830322266
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself	120.21746826171875
elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal	147.65325927734375
but i must tell you how it went off	33.86458206176758
five daughters brought up at home without a governess i never heard of such a thing	68.72084045410156
are the others coming out	30.304798126220703
oh	5.7444658279418945
la	8.785078048706055
while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind she was all all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible	188.84169006347656
after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper	117.08763122558594
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss s meditated elopement	50.389488220214844
she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference	65.13912200927734
not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror mr gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spirit every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled	255.93898010253906
vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously	94.95545196533203
we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect	57.946449279785156
it would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of	98.05659484863281
elizabeth made no objection the door was then allowed to be shut and the carriage drove off	68.23082733154297
chapter xxi the discussion of mr s offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother	151.51641845703125
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and every body began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness	128.99029541015625
they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of bare morality to listen to	134.93836975097656
wholly inattentive to her s feelings lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy calling for every s congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish	215.39889526367188
you will be censured slighted and despised by every one connected with him	69.99037170410156
i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself	83.03404235839844
if i was to go through the world i could not meet with a better	58.58576965332031
i wish you had been there	23.724868774414062
i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting	183.50953674316406
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she been the <unk> was wretched in the thought of what her sister must <unk>	181.50877380371094
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a <unk> situation and always spending more than they ought	102.38162994384766
every body said how well she looked and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice	83.25630950927734
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange	143.4999542236328
i know you will contrive it all	26.35727882385254
my dear brother at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope will give you satisfaction	134.7267608642578
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure	105.92573547363281
reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections	190.6063232421875
mr jones says we must not think of moving her	49.59926223754883
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mr bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was though mr s sour looks and natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away	294.6593017578125
their visitors staid with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mr gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country	195.19288635253906
she was teazed by mr collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others	165.33395385742188
park might do said she if the gouldings would quit it or the great house at stoke if the room were larger but ashworth is too far off	183.32432556152344
you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition	85.8143310546875
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself	181.04141235351562
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening	119.57608032226562
i will have no reserves from you	20.071083068847656
chapter ii after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday	125.14107513427734
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumerating the <unk> of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his <unk> side	290.5527648925781
it was agreed to	16.651687622070312
if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it	111.51258850097656
his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of gratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do	224.33319091796875
darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and mr hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her s conversation with miss bennet	145.52255249023438
and elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself soon went away	85.60136413574219
but as it happens they are all of them very clever	44.620582580566406
even elizabeth began to not that bingley was but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away	103.56895446777344
there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty who can it be	51.76736068725586
cried his wife impatiently	27.90506362915039
he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire	81.02651977539062
sir william only smiled	18.14757537841797
she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions	45.00996017456055
come here child cried her father as she appeared	42.052276611328125
you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general	54.97088623046875
there can be no doubt of that	27.176332473754883
mr philips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see mr s shop boy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed towards mr collins by s introduction of him	484.62091064453125
when tea was over mr hurst reminded his law of the but in vain	64.7392807006836
take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment	53.0560302734375
and it was not wholly without foundation	35.86785125732422
no my dear i think not	25.447952270507812
that is a failing indeed	30.165016174316406
mr darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once	54.90119934082031
when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject	51.22427749633789
you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time	153.9364013671875
the s <unk> or federal tax <unk> number is	67.60323333740234
he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere	93.81605529785156
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy	101.05150604248047
if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity	171.5777587890625
and of this place thought she i might have been mistress	52.06428909301758
in the room they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before	95.8146743774414
the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value	66.85887908935547
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject	51.64533233642578
in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks and to mr gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction	105.02364349365234
mr gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder	111.9278335571289
soon after you left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were	95.75373077392578
not a soul knew of it but col	40.52293395996094
it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day	83.98460388183594
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement <unk> the law of the state applicable to this agreement the agreement shall be <unk> to make the <unk> disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law	175.13394165039062
yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside	53.512062072753906
my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her	56.733123779296875
of a fine stout healthy love it may	40.84152603149414
he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on	90.7682113647461
to s assertion of her s being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit	63.35062789916992
the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence	118.78456115722656
and your defect is a propensity to hate every body	42.89927673339844
what is he coming home and without poor lydia	53.366310119628906
well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say	60.327388763427734
you have employed your time much better	33.84357452392578
i send no compliments to your mother	30.317232131958008
when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr bingley it was an animating subject and mr bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match	322.038818359375
in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was	48.22849655151367
a little time therefore i shall certainly try to get the better	48.94520950317383
he is perfectly amiable	18.55586051940918
i think you said she was a widow sir	43.01606369018555
any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to mr darcy about it if you had rather not	141.00262451171875
donations are accepted in a number of other ways including <unk> online payments and credit card donations	140.77964782714844
for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody	54.80448913574219
my father began life in the profession which your uncle mr philips appears to do so much credit but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property	180.73544311523438
he did look at it and into it for half an hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately	155.28077697753906
certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with	152.75323486328125
she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her s spirits	74.85498046875
the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed	76.4766845703125
mr s chief object was unquestionably my s fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement	125.98627471923828
she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but mr bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage	88.44824981689453
the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cookery was owing	115.61219024658203
what do you keep winking at me for	33.74053192138672
elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately	37.69747543334961
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wickham with money	65.12816619873047
mr gardiner abused her stupidity	20.473831176757812
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest s infamous elopement	45.32063293457031
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment	88.73358917236328
i dare say you will find him very agreeable	29.218862533569336
i am by no means of opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her	494.0246276855469
and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley	67.57220458984375
it had better have happened to you lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner	81.97779083251953
mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them	117.92970275878906
this account then is what he has received from mr darcy	46.561058044433594
but what does he say of the living	30.187541961669922
well cried elizabeth have it as you choose	39.693172454833984
it was drawn at the same time as the about eight years ago	54.88154220581055
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by s marriage but as she thought it advisable to <unk> the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as <unk> and paid off every <unk> of civility to elizabeth	274.10321044921875
though it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit	179.4349365234375
but the case is this	21.359907150268555
but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me these causes must be stated though briefly the situation of your s family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father pardon me it pains me to offend you	1168.9654541015625
he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father	132.3054656982422
but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride	87.0441665649414
chapter vi the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him	101.85595703125
things are settled so oddly	42.91015625
and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mr forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me	110.75054931640625
poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder	99.73999786376953
he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem	75.15971374511719
lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now	85.2535629272461
not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it	130.6150665283203
the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of s dying an old maid	190.67982482910156
you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short silence	66.68531036376953
not these two or three years perhaps	37.05195999145508
in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house	110.53783416748047
your affectionate friend lydia bennet oh	36.3063850402832
i should not have been allowed to invite them	29.642330169677734
it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to mr darcy	127.50232696533203
this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once	91.51461029052734
i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter	109.16793060302734
sir you quite misunderstand me said mr bennet alarmed	57.38037872314453
if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark	173.4973907470703
certainly he replied <unk> his lips	33.07150650024414
they agreed that mr bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the s conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together	255.04367065429688
his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events mr wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited	252.32643127441406
chapter viii mr bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him	223.16490173339844
only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me	91.66810607910156
perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often	76.5831069946289
by the author of sense and sensibility	22.831632614135742
not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months	138.6308135986328
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her s indignation would have been	166.10986328125
dearest jane	13.711132049560547
he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister	277.3870544433594
from s thoughts it was never absent	42.90870666503906
my child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life	77.63494873046875
it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane	48.28107452392578
and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married	92.0902099609375
you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper	73.89219665527344
what does he say	19.517942428588867
s astonishment was beyond expression	26.13528060913086
but i confess they would have no charms for me	34.09022521972656
let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood	62.69316101074219
after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner and thus began in vain have i struggled	119.47557067871094
she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise	78.97955322265625
is it not clear enough does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her s indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to put me on my guard	233.3062744140625
with your good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others	64.35739135742188
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents	100.88544464111328
it is nearly fifty miles	26.077375411987305
how odious i should think them	34.52959442138672
i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had	49.26447677612305
i expected you to stay two months	30.762897491455078
jane then took it from her book and gave it to elizabeth	43.890628814697266
in ran mr bennet to her s room in her dressing gown and with her hair half finished crying out my dear jane make haste and hurry down	179.44058227539062
how could i be so silly as to wish it	40.739078521728516
but she had no reason to fear mr and mr s curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication	80.16891479492188
dr <unk> b <unk> chief <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> section	81.6625747680664
mr collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received	105.60225677490234
lady catherine rose also and they turned back	33.9410400390625
she will follow wherever lydia leads	49.9412956237793
good or bad	20.911571502685547
at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each other	138.10389709472656
she is a great fool for going away if she liked him	44.3365478515625
their father then went to the library to write and the girls walked into the room	66.72681427001953
but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london	54.58917999267578
nobody wants him to come	25.014310836791992
she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal	276.9198913574219
i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philips	87.25444030761719
nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general <unk> to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them	180.02391052246094
if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh	112.24654388427734
i know them a little	23.25393295288086
she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either	135.6775665283203
miss lydia is going to be married and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding	89.16504669189453
jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness	57.24344253540039
how i laughed	18.24254035949707
yes yes	9.386853218078613
if he wants our society let him seek it	50.78634262084961
if he had been <unk> before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity <unk> could make him	210.41278076171875
you will have a charming law indeed and of course she will be always at pemberley with you	69.88453674316406
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss s voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family	121.35789489746094
her performance on the forte is exquisite	35.55758285522461
information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation project tm <unk> upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and <unk> works that can be freely distributed in <unk> readable form <unk> by the widest <unk> of equipment including <unk> equipment	242.84799194335938
her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it rained hard	72.52477264404297
but i have always observed that they who are natured when children are natured when they grow up and he was always the tempered most hearted boy in the world	117.96646881103516
in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of	56.73351287841797
mr philips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before	84.34904479980469
she was received however very politely by them and in their s manners there was something better than politeness there was good humour and kindness mr darcy said very little and mr hurst nothing at all	148.11871337890625
elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them	127.9518814086914
yes very different	17.374120712280273
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there	60.97404098510742
you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring indeed you have no reason	60.35400390625
after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display	264.6533508300781
i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older	85.73957061767578
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of s	55.45866394042969
that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter	55.29548645019531
we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary	80.037353515625
in three volumes	14.21401596069336
but alas	11.137224197387695
mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention	35.30482482910156
as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer	70.82366943359375
i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself	35.72168731689453
i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though mr collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the forte in mr s room	197.94041442871094
caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself	124.58638763427734
what has she frightened away some of your lovers	53.512115478515625
i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away	140.22531127929688
though suspicion was very far from miss s general habits she was absolutely incredulous here	92.0535659790039
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the s last week and even mr darcy acknowledged that the <unk> were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three <unk> <unk> at least	172.84530639648438
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened	87.84130859375
the subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted by the conceit of a weak head living in retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity	219.14804077148438
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard	160.73114013671875
but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very next day	60.428287506103516
he then said i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly	67.34566497802734
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was	195.27789306640625
have you heard from my uncle	26.953767776489258
if it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful	141.59933471679688
but not before they went to brighton	34.09772491455078
elizabeth could bear it no longer	29.82058334350586
the letter was to this effect	24.012449264526367
	6.400625228881836
lady catherine de s attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable	77.16517639160156
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you	125.79298400878906
he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride	121.03164672851562
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable	85.22438049316406
and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother	44.94308853149414
her father lifted up his eyes	25.317113876342773
s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another	279.5169982910156
respect esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown	106.8399429321289
the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty	246.37850952148438
when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence	207.72915649414062
not that i mean to find fault with you for such things i know are all chance in this world	94.70122528076172
then who taught you	25.556201934814453
i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been	90.0713119506836
while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them	69.6999740600586
are sufficiently known	20.880508422851562
you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly	137.84486389160156
the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about seven was s intimate friend	112.51762390136719
be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy	43.675079345703125
after welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming is not this nice	134.35989379882812
if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go	53.39824676513672
law of wickham	21.14028549194336
from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him	93.55888366699219
i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished	80.20549774169922
one came from her books and the other from her toilette	48.42991638183594
elizabeth replied that it was	21.852611541748047
what a charming amusement for young people this is mr darcy there is nothing like dancing after all i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies	126.20447540283203
we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said jane	59.8936653137207
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information	102.37200164794922
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life every body had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful	221.67210388183594
because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to	121.05316162109375
as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following manner you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my journey hither	119.75081634521484
and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them	117.17997741699219
he has given in all his debts i hope at least he has not deceived us	69.63026428222656
when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the card tables were placed	77.27873992919922
we dressed up chamberlayne in s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady only think what fun	89.93244171142578
having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business	251.650146484375
it was my brother s drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it	90.1888198852539
how he must have felt it	26.230045318603516
how so	15.32341194152832
she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess	165.032470703125
when her mother went up to her room at night she followed her and made the important communication	76.41116333007812
you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them	40.013248443603516
she was engaged one day as she walked in perusing s last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by mr darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her	208.8260498046875
she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed	83.89960479736328
and men take care that they should	36.31840133666992
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen	38.742549896240234
cried lydia	10.439520835876465
but are you pleased jane	25.72907257080078
the picture gallery and two or three of the principal rooms were all that remained to be shewn	73.18508911132812
this is your <unk> resolve	21.606306076049805
the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do	174.28781127929688
for your sake turning to charlotte i am glad of it but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de s family do you play and sing miss bennet	192.54783630371094
they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her	96.61636352539062
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and s arrival	59.70924377441406
my father bears it better	24.282352447509766
yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no <unk> received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister <unk> the admiration of her former lover	196.7071075439453
here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of	67.62722778320312
why he has four or five thousand year and very likely more	68.47299194335938
i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding	57.39852523803711
mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his son his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed	242.14305114746094
every body is disgusted with his pride	36.75894546508789
the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable like set and the best of them were of the present party but mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as they were superior to the faced stuffy uncle philips breathing port wine who followed them into the room	255.31771850585938
rendered spiritless by the success of all their endeavours he had yielded to his s intreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit	161.92005920410156
oh that i knew how it was	30.552005767822266
her ease and good spirits increased	44.04570770263672
it cannot be concealed from any one	29.445064544677734
he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner	157.50607299804688
but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them	44.410614013671875
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they had known any thing of the matter	194.5635223388672
and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me	76.10366821289062
i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham i can hardly be just to him	63.42353820800781
but when she read and read with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of s resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate	181.04531860351562
jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing else gave way before the hope of s being in the fairest way for happiness	276.2501525878906
i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united	82.50393676757812
i do not know i hope there was but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult	71.2974624633789
i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever	64.20555877685547
but i believe your opinion of him would in general and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else here you are in your own family	139.298828125
i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy	35.07209396362305
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness	97.0724105834961
there was no arguing upon such a project	53.84417724609375
she is grown so brown and coarse	58.16692352294922
you are a very strange creature by way of a friend always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers	265.762939453125
here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind	244.3389434814453
but from what the report of their engagement could <unk> elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply the idea	238.92059326171875
indeed i do not dare	21.78685188293457
when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in s astonishment at her being so thin and so small	210.578857421875
human nature is so prone to fall into it	41.35673522949219
chapter ix their s wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself	104.20813751220703
information about the mission of project tm project tm is <unk> with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including <unk> old <unk> and new computers	188.6205291748047
i am so so happy	20.4793758392334
i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred year during my life and fifty after i am gone	135.63946533203125
mr bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could	133.36038208007812
she could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on	80.06961059570312
when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother s in town so much in love with her that my law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away	141.070068359375
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable	140.59185791015625
but you have chosen your fault well i really cannot laugh at it	57.01123046875
colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hours after the express	76.68135833740234
she studied every sentence	23.524734497070312
i do not wish to avoid the walk	28.17819595336914
in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour	94.03414916992188
s c	9.10502815246582
miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed	112.47628784179688
mr bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments	42.034629821777344
but elizabeth was not formed for humour and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice	342.6583251953125
miss elizabeth bennet	20.636428833007812
a s acquaintance is certainly very little	36.317657470703125
and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into	176.7525634765625
there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard	116.9239501953125
but lizzy you can tell us whether it is like or not	50.708255767822266
let us sit down	19.4571590423584
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate	113.3516616821289
elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley	53.41917419433594
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair	40.19660949707031
darcy was delighted with their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of it	67.41080474853516
i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me it is done however and it was done for the best on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer	389.00115966796875
it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush	80.96363067626953
the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness	67.17878723144531
so do not put yourself to inconvenience	44.53164291381836
about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon	53.65855026245117
do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain	121.30191802978516
oh sister	15.739274024963379
but think no more of the letter	28.595458984375
there could be no conversation in the noise of mr s supper party but his manners recommended him to every body	80.33856201171875
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for s sake he assisted him farther in his profession	107.7206802368164
most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote	66.97283172607422
when first mr bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son	102.1180648803711
but do you always write such charming long letters to her mr darcy	73.35829162597656
i always had a value for him	34.372127532958984
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr s	89.94524383544922
you need not distress yourself	21.681529998779297
i shall go distracted	16.72354507446289
i know it all that the young s marrying her was a up business at the expence of your father and uncles	107.216064453125
he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein	108.42576599121094
i am impatient to see him	17.378095626831055
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once	268.35009765625
the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift	100.3358383178711
by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st s had made him courteous	77.54773712158203
elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself	129.64938354492188
she felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained	248.4783935546875
i hope and trust they will yet be happy	40.44411087036133
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought only six with him from london his five sisters and a cousin	219.40347290039062
no i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself	44.22172546386719
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out	98.58988189697266
if darcy does not put it off again	38.39937210083008
i am sure you will be very comfortable there	26.617944717407227
elizabeth smiled	10.012856483459473
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the <unk> were silent	56.537452697753906
this will never do	18.22345542907715
he cannot know what mr darcy is	26.590164184570312
it was a subject in short on which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing	68.0799560546875
well then you need not be under any alarm	44.89448547363281
no officer is ever to enter my house again nor even to pass through the village	74.54732513427734
he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever lived	59.96757507324219
i came to try you	20.32492446899414
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became perfect as plan could be	100.39620208740234
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them	130.68472290039062
but you are always giving her the preference	41.18839645385742
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast	33.47574234008789
elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room	290.3874816894531
his temptation is not adequate to the risk	51.115665435791016
elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend	59.64387893676758
chapter v within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate	78.36238098144531
he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification <unk> on such a research in which <unk> had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally <unk> the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce	403.4134826660156
darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure	164.49557495117188
mr collins was gratified and with a more smiling solemnity replied it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably	113.39114379882812
indeed	8.307234764099121
cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable	144.21633911132812
i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain	65.6269760131836
<url> <unk> editions will <unk> the previous the old editions will be <unk>	85.88318634033203
lord	9.11855411529541
oh	5.7444658279418945
to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ancles in dirt and alone quite alone	152.9539337158203
said elizabeth	8.749918937683105
and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry	42.108009338378906
true said mr bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befal you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it	158.7819061279297
said charlotte as soon as he was gone	28.601303100585938
it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be animated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of s attractions	134.51564025878906
thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be angry	86.40394592285156
if he did <unk> his <unk> it was not till sir william was out of sight	69.0860824584961
you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us	107.95014953613281
it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter	63.67292785644531
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again therefore stay quietly at longbourn and depend on my diligence and care	99.26348114013672
my s intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing	69.03945922851562
my aunt told me so herself on saturday	38.401145935058594
i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me	55.390769958496094
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of any thing else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise	157.16372680664062
ah	7.231865882873535
elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion	85.96084594726562
i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends but of this hereafter	162.34730529785156
assistance is impossible condolence insufferable	34.399112701416016
there is a lady it seems a mr younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what	145.8907928466797
it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself	225.92620849609375
whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr bennet were dead	205.07200622558594
mary and kitty were both with mr bennet	34.059749603271484
he has more to give	22.85915184020996
cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction	26.428354263305664
there can be no love in all this	32.0456428527832
excuse my interference it was kindly meant	49.96278762817383
the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it	120.87112426757812
my affections and wishes are <unk> but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever	87.16576385498047
the house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady s behaviour was most friendly and obliging	99.06816101074219
at night she opened her heart to jane	38.36897659301758
very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such heartedness in any of the family	173.8541259765625
but what is to be done about pemberley	32.71699142456055
she represented to him all the improprieties of s general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mr forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home	213.77476501464844
that is all settled	18.31776237487793
i dislike it very much he replied but it must be done	42.09646987915039
with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success	125.38745880126953
and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that you have actually seen pemberley	69.23806762695312
i beg you would not put it into s head to be vexed by his treatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him	128.10955810546875
i will take care of myself and of mr wickham too	43.029808044433594
and gravely glancing at mr darcy there is a fine old saying which every body here is of course familiar keep your breath to cool your porridge and i shall keep mine to swell my song	170.50540161132812
she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers	88.14632415771484
but jane was to go home with her and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation	66.12867736816406
if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy	71.29449462890625
my dear continued mr bennet i am quite delighted with him	34.01600646972656
when they repaired to the room elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister	124.64120483398438
happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over	60.801761627197266
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it	217.27871704101562
we talked and laughed so loud that any body might have heard us ten miles off	87.64015197753906
had she found jane in any apparent danger mr bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield	206.39125061035156
she approached and saw the likeness of mr wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the piece	84.09931182861328
at length however mr bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken	159.33694458007812
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous	58.02165985107422
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter s observation and hurried her away to her room	126.27664947509766
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great s attention which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others	98.4864501953125
said she	11.40506362915039
mr gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk	70.04467010498047
bingley	11.046175003051758
and quite alone	21.030006408691406
mr s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair	133.42027282714844
but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule	121.85099029541016
when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again	71.2520751953125
they are my old friends	23.59731674194336
i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him	68.67831420898438
again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification	71.18548583984375
a carat character is used to denote superscription	73.15751647949219
why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did before him	74.0243911743164
we will settle with your father about the money afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately	96.16909790039062
here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country	66.2909927368164
you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased	83.36077880859375
mr wickham after a few moments touched his a salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return	97.91122436523438
i am happier even than jane she only smiles i laugh	57.28864288330078
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter	37.81595993041992
well well i only hope it will last	40.10386276245117
the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced	274.15692138671875
there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects	78.81871032714844
as often as i can	25.218812942504883
i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these	60.54307174682617
we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome	233.142333984375
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself	84.07677459716797
i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require	55.56045913696289
the rector of a parish has much to do in the first place he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron	130.52426147460938
his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it	88.0271987915039
his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire	76.96674346923828
society i own is necessary to me	34.880348205566406
mr s respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master	67.42031860351562
now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence	47.89796829223633
she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word	79.7145004272461
a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of their three acquaintance they had been intimate two	143.75973510742188
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place	112.65904235839844
she found that she was to receive no other and after a short pause added i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again	111.50038146972656
it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mr bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life	176.70028686523438
you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half hour	184.6020050048828
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the <unk> family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune	180.12318420410156
i can much more easily believe mr s being imposed on than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts every thing mentioned without ceremony if it be not so let mr darcy contradict it	272.2887878417969
in talking over their route the evening before mr gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again	84.42813873291016
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states	65.02800750732422
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word	41.355690002441406
so much the man of fashion	27.45498275756836
her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her	209.82723999023438
chapter xvii elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr wickham and herself	61.625999450683594
a house in town	23.234495162963867
it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast	58.161415100097656
volunteers and <unk> support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching project s <unk> and <unk> that the project tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come	159.45692443847656
it is just as he chooses	23.55145835876465
then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman	76.87110137939453
and a special licence	16.863880157470703
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends	134.77392578125
how mr darcy looked therefore she could not tell	40.78166961669922
you may use this ebook for nearly any purpose such as <unk> of derivative works <unk> <unk> and research	106.89511108398438
miss s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps	105.54705810546875
louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again	51.14542007446289
you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one	51.861976623535156
could she exert herself it would be better but this is not to be expected and as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected	127.7508773803711
these recollections will not do at all	34.45265579223633
you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer	60.75697326660156
i had not an idea of it	23.97618865966797
you need not send them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham	179.7677764892578
he is but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner	106.82965850830078
i could hardly keep my countenance	29.08934783935547
no one but mr bennet <unk> that their stay would be so short and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home	149.99940490722656
she cried	12.885185241699219
she answered him with cold civility	26.152132034301758
mr darcy corroborated it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting	209.55609130859375
the express was sent off directly	25.554519653320312
i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly	45.05065155029297
the suspicions which had just arisen of mr darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded enquiry and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love	198.2886505126953
do you really think so	23.367372512817383
mr bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer	142.54335021972656
mr gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her	60.71122741699219
elizabeth read on i have seen them both	42.846282958984375
so much the better	17.862825393676758
i began to be afraid you would never come back again	39.60371017456055
how hard it is in some cases to be believed	44.212398529052734
this is the estimation in which you hold me	34.17051315307617
yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but that was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance	153.8764190673828
your s conduct does not suit my feelings	32.99393081665039
the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of s infamy somewhat better	273.12030029296875
that he should even speak to her was amazing but to speak with such civility to enquire after her family	95.15241241455078
at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house	74.37430572509766
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate	182.4330596923828
he promises fairly and i hope among different people where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent	154.53512573242188
mr s attention was caught and after observing mr collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh	158.43150329589844
she shook her head	15.81568717956543
my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other	47.440425872802734
miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present	183.26144409179688
his most particular friend you see by s account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her	103.54894256591797
she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk	100.84996795654297
when mr collins could be forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by s evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten	156.01966857910156
but mr bennet was not so well pleased with it	35.001766204833984
had you behaved in a more like manner those were your words	68.20563507080078
but how did he account for it	30.76708984375
i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object	166.2200469970703
in a short time i shall have a daughter married	33.926971435546875
i guessed as much	27.708566665649414
i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers	104.63933563232422
they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not like at all and in her air altogether there is a sufficiency without fashion which is intolerable	170.44020080566406
true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room	50.13188171386719
she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like s two sisters	186.11892700195312
for s sake madam speak lower what advantage can it be to you to offend mr darcy you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing	163.5697479248047
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy had been rated elizabeth had never yet answered mr s long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows	262.8384094238281
i know it to be impossible	18.0557804107666
colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body	108.32647705078125
nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts	247.7710418701172
by you i was properly humbled	34.47352600097656
but why all this secrecy	35.25278854370117
but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their s	76.16323852539062
let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility	70.12767791748047
when the ladies returned to the room there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted	225.0130157470703
neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight	87.7535629272461
elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit	54.177886962890625
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting	47.695621490478516
as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for s sake she made more favourable than it really was	160.4739227294922
indeed i am	14.947320938110352
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure	62.45899200439453
but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem	72.35591125488281
in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy	178.09378051757812
i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more	49.13621139526367
he cannot afford it	19.53317642211914
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame	81.35746765136719
it was really a very handsome thought	33.92388916015625
my dear mr bennet as she entered the room we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball	86.82684326171875
what think you of books	25.772628784179688
dear me	12.222346305847168
he readily agreed to it	26.477542877197266
i am dear sir c	23.940034866333008
because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement	51.13734436035156
but if i were you i would stand by the nephew	55.32176971435547
la	8.785078048706055
next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky	61.399681091308594
no aunt no officers no news could be sought after the very roses for netherfield were got by proxy	142.87881469726562
a gamester	24.95718002319336
a long dispute followed this declaration but mr bennet was firm	62.186397552490234
to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed	355.23773193359375
if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him	46.84941101074219
it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but i assure you it is much larger than sir william s	85.79936218261719
i speak feelingly	30.541610717773438
what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mr darcy had much better finish his letter	101.51653289794922
she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will make her know it	80.58558654785156
on mr and mr s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness	129.82122802734375
why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight	73.94490814208984
my dear charlotte impossible	20.672780990600586
very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same	173.97389221191406
he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her	103.72808837890625
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her but however he did not admire her at all	75.70048522949219
i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation	77.2281265258789
she was at least free from the offence of mr s farther notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak	178.29058837890625
nothing of the past was recollected with pain and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world	136.1110076904297
invented by bell charlotte street bedford square	42.057193756103516
they followed her into the parlour	28.470394134521484
but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend	262.21075439453125
what relates to yourself is as follows	32.86880111694336
they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of every thing but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mr gardiner thought of him and mr gardiner would have been highly gratified by her s beginning the subject	211.7241668701172
with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the parlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee	101.52317810058594
his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham	73.43158721923828

project gutenberg also has an html version of this file which includes the original illustrations	58.666961669921875
mr hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep	84.69380187988281
she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet	179.0913848876953
if there were but such another man for you	42.415164947509766
every thing that is charming	24.98733901977539
after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended himself	251.16563415527344
colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on s side but nothing to give him any alarm	86.2503662109375
at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life	147.70968627929688
it will be her turn soon to be teazed said miss lucas	48.860450744628906
after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view mr collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer	223.3870849609375
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively <unk> manner of talking to her brother	143.74896240234375
i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young s intimates in the regiment whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself	206.15142822265625
do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends	50.33625411987305
such an openness and gentleness in his manner	34.35568618774414
elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went up stairs together	56.53378677368164
you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say	72.25244140625
i am so happy	14.977095603942871
the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit	123.48209381103516
one ought not to repine but to be sure it would have been such a thing for me	57.634254455566406
my father however is partial to mr wickham	31.293685913085938
in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well	93.64332580566406
i am quite well	13.856597900390625
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship	68.63398742675781
an hour however saw the whole completed and mr gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn	246.5765380859375
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty	145.0419464111328
i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister	213.39247131347656
your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr darcy	135.65980529785156
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mr bennet they had several children	116.37468719482422
two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge	93.17101287841797
you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy	100.88388061523438
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss s inattention	89.93352508544922
i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter	79.12193298339844
mr gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northward than derbyshire	404.4520568847656
printed for t egerton military library whitehall	34.455955505371094
lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me s beauty	63.645572662353516
when at length they arose to take leave mr bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself particularly to mr bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation	283.9313049316406
lydia came to us and wickham had constant <unk> to the house	49.43965530395508
and then when we came away it was such fun	43.53019332885742
but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out	69.90911102294922
it needed all s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity	65.70769500732422
you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire	281.3114929199219
mr s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mr bennet	55.29339599609375
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us	51.69258499145508
can i have the carriage	22.930986404418945
they all paint tables cover skreens and net purses	49.04240798950195
nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled	77.36985778808594
chapter xv mr collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance	278.1502685546875
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it	106.87689971923828
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case	44.21393966674805
then the two third he danced with miss king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane again and the two sixth with lizzy and the if he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently he would not have danced half so much	203.2312469482422
is this to be endured	22.119487762451172
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that mr wickham had resolved on quitting the militia	90.26152038574219
miss bennet i insist on being satisfied	36.69400405883789
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it	111.59423828125
i must confess myself surprised by your application i did not expect it from you	54.87943649291992
mr bennet was quite disconcerted	21.454408645629883
could he expect that her friends would not step forward	43.665245056152344
the business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news	81.15646362304688
yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like un better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded	163.8819122314453
that such a consequence as this should ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts	107.82044982910156
mr collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and mr s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way	171.74278259277344
a younger son you know must be inured to denial and dependence	58.40162658691406
and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike	130.58473205566406
you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing	57.372413635253906
i grieve to find however that colonel f is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared w was not a man to be trusted	160.41725158691406
dear madam cried mr hill in great astonishment t you know there is an express come for master from mr gardiner	102.0667724609375
she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of s neighbours	152.24403381347656
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected	185.32528686523438
he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable house	57.98906326293945
we have not met since the th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield	69.79261779785156
i know little of the game at present said he but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation of mr philips was very thankful for his compliance but could not wait for his reason	151.76316833496094
and what do you think she said besides	35.227760314941406
chapter iv when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of mr bingley before expressed to her sister how very much she admired him	128.6687774658203
i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself	252.15672302246094
and now s mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all	129.8161163330078

but i know the foundation is unjust	31.63111114501953
the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand	97.34212493896484
it was mr s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest	143.22732543945312

heaven forbid that would be the greatest misfortune of all to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me such an evil	157.66665649414062
in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away	78.92784118652344
but i i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly	72.38359069824219
i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies	43.27497863769531
our distress my dear lizzy is very great	34.8881721496582
you have liked many a stupider person	35.743343353271484
our poor mother is sadly grieved	31.51577377319336
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine	121.49577331542969
i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women	57.311073303222656

jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day	110.94523620605469
she opened the door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with agitation cried out oh my dear eliza	100.7753677368164
mr bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party	52.79813766479492
when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least	124.65980529785156
mr collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman	195.93536376953125
chapter iii convinced as elizabeth now was that miss s dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that s side the acquaintance would now be renewed	273.6818542480469
but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went <unk> against the <unk> and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his <unk> <unk> and give the praise where it was due	326.77734375
as they walked across the lawn towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables	185.9108123779297
but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it	41.756351470947266
for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey	220.96914672851562
the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was enough to provoke him	58.89442825317383
their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme	132.68380737304688
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage	90.95540618896484
but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable	39.49275588989258
she had a sister married to a mr philips who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade	136.17095947265625
when she remembered the style of his address she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion	224.1128387451172
it convinced her that accident only could discover to mr bingley her s being in town	81.78059387207031
nothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very sincerely wish him happy	196.90943908691406
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long	104.14945220947266
why must their marriage be private	45.4213752746582
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you	110.73472595214844
i know how much you dislike him	28.734474182128906
mr reynolds could interest her on no other point	47.04436492919922
not at all	15.199553489685059
accompanied by a violent yawn	25.456079483032227
oh	5.7444658279418945
here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery	154.35379028320312
they were natural and just	25.492494583129883
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great	46.212684631347656
one seems so <unk> without them	35.78414535522461
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do	46.9254035949707
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved	326.0776672363281
i say no more than the truth and what every body will say that knows him replied the other	74.84661102294922
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an <unk>	133.4983367919922
mr reynolds anticipated miss s delight when she should enter the room	52.46815490722656
that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance	104.29708099365234
it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living	110.32654571533203
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not	64.9053726196289
she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved	39.47999572753906
while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning	100.9769515991211
i must beg to return to the house	31.51219367980957
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that	95.38053131103516
nor was s vindication though grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery	78.99886322021484
what could he mean	18.106225967407227
can there be any other opinion on the subject	35.98146438598633
mr hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves	99.92582702636719
elizabeth was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes	129.65704345703125
chapter v i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter	186.15367126464844
mr gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send	96.48607635498047
i will leave him to himself	24.271230697631836
a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago	56.792083740234375
but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes	89.61722564697266
we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye	77.68621826171875
now is your time	21.238056182861328
end of vol i illustration	28.426321029663086
what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation	33.973976135253906
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter	179.8944549560547
so he enquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next	92.27445220947266
her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them	151.72821044921875
with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well known fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which mr darcy afterwards discharged	267.5309143066406
and do you really love him quite well enough	40.97038269042969
chapter xvii my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to	53.90999984741211
chapter vii mr s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in default of heirs male on a distant relation and their s fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of his	327.2290344238281
no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room	267.366943359375
the period of expectation was now doubled	30.52743148803711
i can readily believe answered he gravely that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either	267.4314270019531
as for their mother mr s letter had done away much of her will and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters	138.42178344726562
they came	12.37541675567627
you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir	40.73128890991211
will you do me the honour of reading that letter	41.225563049316406
you agree that you have no <unk> for negligence <unk> liability breach of warranty or breach of <unk> except those provided in paragraph f you agree that the foundation the trademark owner and any <unk> under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual direct indirect consequential <unk> or <unk> damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage f limited right of replacement or refund if you discover a defect in this electronic work within days of receiving it you can receive a refund of the money if you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from	512.3856201171875
her nose wants character there is nothing marked in its lines	52.62166976928711
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but mr bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed	132.9871368408203
the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other	55.13450622558594
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mr bingley and talked of mr darcy may be guessed	82.0673599243164
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it	99.65861511230469
when the things were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a <unk> to her s <unk> for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party	288.2490539550781
mr darcy and so it does i <unk>	37.16057586669922
she says lizzy had better have taken mr collins but i do not think there would have been any fun in it	77.50897979736328
to his <unk> engagement with miss de bourgh	30.182231903076172
mr and mr gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy though lydia had never been a favourite with them mr and mr gardiner could not but be deeply affected	319.8949890136719
she felt that she had no business at pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it	92.54407501220703
she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false	80.5838394165039
before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise mr bennet instantly answered oh dear certainly i am sure lizzy will be very i am sure she can have no objection come kitty i want you up stairs	184.73973083496094
one s delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual	100.16476440429688
miss lucas is married and settled	27.731760025024414
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them	91.34910583496094
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible	164.0031280517578
to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own	84.93484497070312
lydia gaped as he opened the volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with do you know mama that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him	187.7675323486328
mr reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn when she was only eight years old	101.4169692993164
and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now	98.41243743896484
yes madam said mr bennet delighted to speak to a lady catherine	48.2001953125
but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbad the disclosure	57.257293701171875
indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance	83.25093078613281
i shall like it of all things	30.653730392456055
yes yes they must marry	21.25421714782715
when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so	80.79109954833984
indeed i had	19.232133865356445
it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley	68.2693862915039
i never saw such a woman	20.832077026367188
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged	86.47366333007812
as her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence	94.77891540527344
and then we were so merry all the way home	42.301849365234375
mr gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself	148.41127014160156
and yours he replied with a smile is wilfully to misunderstand them	51.8769416809082
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty	153.0315704345703
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley i can guess the subject of your reverie	137.0578155517578
the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly on his side even more	84.04317474365234
i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable informed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have <unk> domestic felicity in so <unk> a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly	398.4677429199219
how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains	58.99884033203125
my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not lady catherine	68.0125961303711
elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his s praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation	252.66220092773438
that is all to be forgot	21.832487106323242
his revenge would have been complete indeed	28.841840744018555
they have none of them much to recommend them replied he they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters	142.70729064941406
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer	64.1723403930664
she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter	96.44209289550781
do not let us quarrel about the past	34.2815055847168
not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise	45.47203826904297
her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business	153.15101623535156
i t know	16.806764602661133
oh lizzy	9.212966918945312
s reception of them was very civil but attended with all that embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved	192.0914764404297
but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet	168.93972778320312
his countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue	72.7470932006836
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her composedly lady catherine was a tall large woman with marked features which might once have been handsome	136.7789764404297
she had always seen it with pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible	242.05104064941406
she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being mr darcy she was directly retreating	158.5818634033203
in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist	353.6618347167969
why you never dropt a word of this you sly thing	57.90363311767578
if your master would marry you might see more of him	53.27820587158203
bingley was by no means deficient but darcy was clever	46.60602569580078
charlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard	75.55147552490234
the housekeeper came forward and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman the son of her late s steward who had been brought up by him at his own expence he is now gone into the army she added but i am afraid he has turned out very wild	188.40640258789062
that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily	56.212608337402344
sir william had been delighted with him	24.501821517944336
imprudent as a marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland	165.72511291503906
i will put on my things in a moment	42.271934509277344
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character	136.60545349121094
ten thousand a year	22.17789077758789
mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride	38.63185119628906
chapter xv the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly	149.4053192138672
my style of writing is very different from yours	45.21334457397461
i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton	50.53336715698242
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct	72.3577651977539
elizabeth said no but her mind could not acquiesce	41.185462951660156
i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts but with him i believe it does not often happen	130.4020233154297
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected	110.87284851074219
look here i have bought this bonnet	47.342376708984375
my father was not only fond of this young s society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it	197.1215362548828
you are quite right	17.99758529663086
i congratulate her	13.972091674804688
miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to know that i am not to be <unk> with	82.5785903930664
and with a bow to mr darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room many stared many smiled but no one looked more amused than mr bennet himself while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a whisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man	288.0044250488281
elizabeth would not observe her and when at last kitty did she very <unk> said what is the matter mamma	106.0585708618164
as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth	201.40023803710938
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his <unk> and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune	189.9645538330078
an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers to own the truth with wickham imagine our surprise	184.27267456054688
your father of course may spare you if your mother can daughters are never of so much consequence to a father	104.15715026855469
what i have to say relates to poor lydia	50.468101501464844
what hours of transport we shall spend	39.906105041503906
their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush	64.85375213623047
the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late mr darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words	160.94357299804688
this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr wickham	153.9632568359375
to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister farther	501.69512939453125
now lizzy i think i have surprised you	32.61528396606445
she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance	109.5433578491211
he immediately offered to fetch her others all that his library afforded	57.322792053222656
this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer the windows are full west	81.41293334960938
how acutely did she now feel it	32.162147521972656
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr s attentions	170.24427795410156
having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than first attachments often boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity	356.7503967285156
his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars	107.84831237792969
by this time she is actually with them	35.64118194580078
much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married	255.30136108398438
chapter xii in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day	118.09281921386719
and is it really true	22.62308692932129
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mr collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her s dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power	311.4317626953125
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as s he might become a very agreeable companion	250.73516845703125
laugh as much as you chuse but you will not laugh me out of my opinion	61.51412582397461
it was very little less	20.038536071777344
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel s	58.545413970947266
and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect unconcern oh	91.70281219482422
to know that her daughter would be married was enough	39.582763671875
lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth	152.68466186523438
oh lydia	11.896578788757324
while there was an officer in meryton they would flirt with him and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn they would be going there for ever	128.52474975585938
he was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and every body hoped that he would never come there again	72.39790344238281
<url> this web site includes information about project tm including how to make donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation how to help produce our new ebooks and how to <unk> to our email <unk> to hear about new ebooks	183.54026794433594
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with it is your turn to say something now mr darcy i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples	190.8513946533203
elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word	38.54314041137695
i am not now to learn replied mr collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time	236.5187530517578
his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her s reproach prevented his feeling any regret	123.49391174316406
if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up	80.86913299560547
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand	34.662837982177734
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of s being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless	215.55178833007812
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned	232.96995544433594
and she rose as she spoke	27.736995697021484
you are not well enough you cannot go yourself	35.69813537597656
an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth	39.12493896484375
far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter	131.01402282714844
my dear sir i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire	220.76084899902344
tis as good as a lord	28.696290969848633
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a and at this ball what do you think he did	119.83300018310547
the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person	127.81903839111328
when mr collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte	113.96305084228516
the business was therefore soon settled	25.52522087097168
good heaven	10.426671028137207
but if you have got them day said elizabeth my s purpose will be answered	63.71993637084961
have all her friends left her	32.836082458496094
distribution of this or any project tm work alteration <unk> or additions or <unk> to any project tm work and any defect you cause	80.07486724853516
kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do	59.026695251464844
good gracious	9.208251953125
her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it	57.1534538269043
it is useless to talk of it	25.713642120361328
he placed himself by her	31.07309341430664
darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again	97.07979583740234
you need not	14.39334487915039
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several weeks	134.14584350585938
let her be called down	25.109834671020508
lady catherine i have nothing farther to say	30.9399471282959
i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage	143.8321075439453
it was lady catherine de bourgh	18.180984497070312
this is a wretched beginning indeed	30.95406150817871
creating the works from public domain <unk> editions means that no one owns a united states copyright in these works so the foundation and you can copy and distribute it in the united states without permission and without paying copyright royalties	179.29550170898438
we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as soon as she was in the hall	82.497802734375
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one	41.74271011352539
pray how violent was mr s love	43.95481491088867
i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was <unk> i felt no doubt of their happiness together	200.20437622070312
after making every possible enquiry on that side london colonel f came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and hatfield but without any success no such people had been seen to pass through	196.52059936523438
you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage	56.47535705566406
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine	62.278053283691406
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance	152.50692749023438
and poor mr darcy	21.096342086791992
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with anxious parade walk up to her s right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister ah	136.66586303710938
mr darcy <unk> you all the love in the world that he can spare from me	69.74242401123047
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her	86.2917251586914
it was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue long	46.633663177490234
i cannot misunderstand you but i intreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk	152.47869873046875
that is what makes it amusing	28.02295684814453
though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you	201.1793670654297
oh	5.7444658279418945
that he should have been in love with her for so many months	48.877567291259766
his character is thereby complete	22.773115158081055
sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion	88.42112731933594
he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible	170.51449584960938
well cried her mother it is all very right who should do it but her own uncle	78.60665130615234
i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful	86.92798614501953
she did indeed louisa	29.52202606201172
her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates	107.96403503417969
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost	43.883995056152344
she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mr bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy	163.66261291503906
i dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy	185.38584899902344
thursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her s ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room	176.31646728515625
i can hardly write for laughing	26.80111312866211
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be	55.06218338012695
but now it comes out	21.912351608276367
i am sure i shall break mine said lydia	30.994869232177734
the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may <unk> to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund	94.46149444580078
there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning	106.58869934082031
are you not diverted	18.140911102294922
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret	65.43342590332031
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr collins joining in observed yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her	189.0690155029297
section	11.028621673583984
i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again	96.923095703125
mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest dullest most bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker	316.90777587890625
oh	5.7444658279418945
your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together	86.58409881591797
may ebook language	35.97026443481445
besides it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they are going in a fortnight	133.77685546875
by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of	195.54055786132812
but they did pass away and mr and mr gardiner with their four children did at length appear at longbourn	80.52233123779297
his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes	80.59739685058594
to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear s vulgar relations	144.21434020996094
it was a fortnight since mr bennet had been down stairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high	129.78330993652344
why any fear of detection	29.88226318359375
i believe him to be lady s nephew	31.487548828125
i thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name	52.53066635131836
mr s adieus were much more affectionate than his s	63.260135650634766
they were not the only objects of mr s admiration	36.919830322265625
the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence	235.1664581298828
now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself	62.50249481201172
if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this	125.92884063720703
do you talk by rule then while you are dancing	63.313026428222656
for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great measure to his kindness	69.9406509399414
he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement	113.9902572631836
from what we have seen of him continued mr gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham	150.57249450683594
miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully	69.1651840209961
what a pity it is mamma we did not all go	44.26997756958008
may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study	96.49706268310547
neglect	12.601545333862305
of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself	82.75045776367188
my feelings in every respect forbid it	31.906047821044922
instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt but no recollecting herself that could never be	151.3931884765625
they must be a great loss to your family	30.094552993774414
i will make no promise of the kind	32.23402404785156
what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt	54.62078857421875
said jane i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her	45.26860809326172
between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular regard	91.19336700439453
i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle	73.14781188964844
miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back the praise on her s warm affection	86.51107025146484
he then asked her to walk into the but she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn	101.84425354003906
are you quite sure am is not there a little mistake	55.732059478759766
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a s shop just over the way	186.83380126953125
his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their opinion of their opinion of every would always coincide there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced that whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing	521.2630615234375
she would not listen therefore to her s proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable	144.91830444335938
how shall i bear so much happiness	32.91132354736328
steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her	185.42599487304688
they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered	151.2398223876953
with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr wickham and the officers mr collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance to the young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mr philips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin	234.95631408691406
mr darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again	90.51344299316406
it was a journey of only four miles and they began it so early as to be in street by noon	86.80585479736328
what is his name	21.555089950561523
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return	105.7240219116211
though i thought it would be very good fun if i was	53.72782897949219
i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him	68.40592193603516
ring the bell kitty for hill	36.44506072998047
elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it	35.95580291748047
mr gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends	100.27356719970703
you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet	84.57372283935547
i should imagine not	19.524702072143555
darcy had walked away to another part of the room	45.49601364135742
and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty	49.56957244873047
if i said mr collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to	319.522216796875
how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it	79.05754852294922
it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either side	137.9756622314453
yes there was something in that i told you so from the first you may remember	67.38610076904297
they were hopeless of remedy	23.933887481689453
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every <unk> speech she had ever directed towards him	107.8747329711914
i write rather slowly	33.03017044067383
but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them	50.33479309082031
while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came	267.85650634765625
i do not know	10.93674087524414
i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn	67.43051147460938
if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mr long	45.754207611083984
that he was surprised by the connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr gardiner	139.93077087402344
oh	5.7444658279418945
but it is of small importance	25.501270294189453
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good humour and cheerfulness began to appear at longbourn	120.0201187133789
your coming to longbourn to see me and my family said elizabeth coolly will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report is in existence	123.77959442138672
i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr s character connections and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state	173.06723022460938
it will pass away soon enough	35.564544677734375
your uncle is as much surprised as i and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done	118.03324127197266
her s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much	140.26025390625
	6.400625228881836
how long has she been such a favourite and pray when am i to wish you joy	71.87347412109375
its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn	141.6171875
our situation with regard to lady s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast	105.96294403076172
mr bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of s behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals	262.7038879394531
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street	239.16358947753906
it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you	81.17273712158203
my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible	164.1499786376953
she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her disposition	163.2273712158203
mr s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family	106.46868133544922
mr collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them	130.38450622558594
but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required	62.58586120605469
he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before	57.7006721496582
this was a lucky idea of mine indeed	32.48735046386719
she cried	12.885185241699219
she turned from sister to sister <unk> their congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there	210.60064697265625
it cannot last long	22.09794044494629
is there nothing you could take to give you present relief a glass of wine shall i get you one you are very ill	123.40901184082031
not one	14.203840255737305
he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his law and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could	194.53997802734375
and his answering immediately to the last oh	39.480960845947266
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy	44.80754470825195
the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten	179.25804138183594
he still loves me and we are engaged	37.16106414794922
it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor	98.37217712402344
it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week	60.449546813964844
darcy in wretched suspense could only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate silence	128.39649963378906
i am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient	57.44806671142578
while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to mr bingley	64.98187255859375
do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will	96.33484649658203
sometime hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before	96.37461853027344
this is delightful indeed she will be married i shall see her again she will be married at sixteen my good kind brother i knew how it would i knew he would manage every thing	151.72628784179688
in every view it is unaccountable	30.283039093017578
he made no answer	15.029877662658691
my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment at my expence when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss s regard for me	128.54437255859375
four nieces of mr jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her	224.7516632080078
they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the s from respectable honourable and <unk> though <unk> families	144.67709350585938
there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law	110.96663665771484
i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time	53.765830993652344
two inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief and the other that she herself had been barbarously used by them all and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day	196.46627807617188
yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight	48.95798873901367
cried he	12.330835342407227
oh	5.7444658279418945
on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks	58.83839416503906
lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty	74.7024917602539
if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it	61.18992233276367
chapter x more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet mr darcy she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd yet it did and even a third	429.5164794921875
darcy said nothing at all	23.333847045898438
good girl	14.297828674316406
both sisters were uncomfortable enough	32.49646759033203
mr bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements	128.30641174316406
said her aunt	14.89681339263916
oh	5.7444658279418945
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mr bennet and the children	56.509334564208984
lady catherine was generally stating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself	79.64451599121094
the <unk> letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished	137.24920654296875
the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised and as he had likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by her s desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear	452.5601501464844
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking	104.98078155517578
oh	5.7444658279418945
we never had any governess	26.208959579467773
and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not mr collins thus addressed her when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character	426.7524108886719
morning dress	21.305925369262695
on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration let me call your maid	181.37295532226562
my beauty you had early <unk> and as for my my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not	171.43148803710938
he is nothing to us you know and i am sure i never want to see him again	55.09672546386719
her s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour	39.743473052978516
her hair so untidy so blowsy	28.684762954711914
i shall be very fit to see which is all i want	48.14186096191406
cried he with more feeling than politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr and mr gardiner	185.4825897216797
dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed	82.80977630615234
indeed mama you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother	42.018577575683594
i shall never forget her appearance this morning	33.5867805480957
that it ought not to be attempted	26.48589515686035
it is more than i engage for i assure you	41.752132415771484
my feelings will not be repressed	22.433794021606445
from that moment i observed my s behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him	115.59066009521484
by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their s admiration	241.47032165527344
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense of shame was severe	154.0153350830078
how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter	45.27810287475586
you have a house in town i conclude	36.940372467041016
the garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge every thing declared they were arriving	97.17832946777344
jane was distressed	14.10140609741211
why is not every body as happy	36.26138687133789
oh	5.7444658279418945
he only told me what i have now told you	38.12022399902344
consider mr s respectability and s prudent steady character	44.043235778808594
but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name	90.7585678100586
such amiable qualities must speak for themselves	40.466400146484375
my dear harriet you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise morrow morning as soon as i am missed	124.81611633300781
but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done	81.90044403076172
oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened	105.76611328125
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother	49.045860290527344
elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings	123.6848373413086
in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any reproach	145.6526641845703
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton	71.73046112060547
yes or i will never see her again	32.805503845214844
and my how is she	27.574058532714844
i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it	84.86263275146484
you shall hear what she says	24.460567474365234
said her mother	13.141530990600586
why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case	64.3829345703125
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much	56.05783462524414
he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security	63.699031829833984
as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown	223.79000854492188
console lady catherine as well as you can	37.360042572021484
she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be	178.0847930908203
mr bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his s mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man	321.8292541503906
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your s being in town	149.92822265625
while sir william was with them mr collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig and shewing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which fronted the road	464.79656982421875
your idea of the ponies is delightful	38.81734085083008
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations	83.39240264892578
as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended either or both had they appeared to be wrong she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister	188.77345275878906
i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard	94.2022476196289
it was all conjecture	21.66973114013672
be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what s infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business	155.9161376953125
you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it	67.2740478515625
it is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy	46.120601654052734
but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country	118.42864227294922
on reaching the house they were shewn through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer	119.89549255371094
they are going to be encamped near brighton and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer	97.59637451171875
one communication would therefore do for all	36.452239990234375
no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called	122.21703338623047
it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt	139.0399627685547
we will know where we have we will recollect what we have seen	57.98591232299805
it originated in mr gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found s arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her s	100.57792663574219
oh you mean jane i because he danced with her twice	49.174312591552734
they were able to love each other even as well as they intended	61.87773895263672
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a scheme of infamy	89.8631820678711
she saw instantly that her s manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family	166.9039306640625
very odd and you only the second the younger ones out before the elder are married your younger sisters must be very young	130.7825469970703
jane austen editor	31.69789695739746
your daughter elizabeth it is <unk> will not long bear the name of bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most <unk> <unk> in this <unk>	210.0703582763672
after this day jane said no more of her indifference	46.455345153808594
they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage mr and mr gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind	84.86329650878906

there could not exist in the world two men over whom mr darcy could have such boundless influence	81.2537612915039
she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her	190.6768341064453
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough	306.9200134277344
his misfortunes	16.948396682739258
elizabeth silently attended her	21.059839248657227
chapter xvii s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr darcy and herself	201.24273681640625
i never saw such a long chin in my life	35.52458953857422
tell her that you insist upon her marrying him	42.567115783691406
caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter	67.04776000976562
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere	121.3503189086914
jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare	44.255855560302734
your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me	90.91783905029297
you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness	156.42857360839844
mr jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she were indisposed	153.31846618652344
his character was to speak for itself	32.16959762573242
a s imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment	87.59040069580078
she could think only of her letter	29.248910903930664
and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident	159.0856475830078
wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him said her sister	60.24635314941406
it cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account	111.33671569824219
but the morrow passed off much better than she expected for mr bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended law that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion	198.8319854736328
i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that	39.40874481201172
f f project gutenberg volunteers and employees <unk> considerable effort to <unk> do copyright research on <unk> and <unk> public domain works in creating the project tm collection	126.21001434326172
elizabeth did not know what to make of it	32.289710998535156
and do you impute it to either of those	35.415592193603516
i remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your wisher and friend william collins at four clock therefore we may expect this making gentleman said mr bennet as he folded up the letter	186.86917114257812
we seem to have been designed for each other	32.969852447509766
they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible	256.18634033203125
i dare say i shall soon see them here	35.863121032714844
when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were	86.8467025756836
i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent	172.33831787109375
can i speak plainer	34.9471321105957
five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and mr bennet for many years after s birth had been certain that he would	140.0569305419922
let me be rightly understood	23.832876205444336
it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it	58.23063659667969
their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr s house where they were to remain a few days	134.41334533691406
he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend	164.98829650878906
the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth dovedale or the peak	185.0286865234375
cried elizabeth when she had finished it	26.538875579833984
but the wife of mr darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine	155.6038818359375
the officer was the very mr denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire and he bowed as they passed	134.67185974121094
she was shewn into the parlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mr hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it	235.3321075439453
you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound	45.263790130615234
unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was <unk> and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and <unk> to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own	350.1954650878906
she is well and <unk> to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother s c	81.21025085449219
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct	83.33631896972656
can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good	66.97291564941406
when is your turn to come	27.172306060791016
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and <unk> of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their <unk>	276.404541015625
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs	45.20936965942383
she shared in their attendance on mr bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom	94.9236831665039
the one missent must be first attended to it had been written five days ago	86.05714416503906
the loss of her daughter made mr bennet very dull for several days	53.52031326293945
i did not think you would and that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion	77.81591796875
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out	48.2337532043457
a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from their walk	139.98902893066406
there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste	111.6812744140625
his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others	138.9816436767578
will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say how much i like him	122.4266586303711
i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder	50.09955596923828
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects	52.683109283447266
we do not suffer by accident	35.0410041809082
after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought considering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation	355.9129638671875
with my mother up stairs	30.980073928833008
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers	269.8321838378906
it was possible however that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something to look forward to	156.04367065429688
but no such recollection befriended her	31.02811050415039
i know not what to think	25.502290725708008
this is not to be borne	17.473886489868164
but on second thoughts perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person	99.06892395019531
of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find	105.72685241699219
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mr annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post	233.58799743652344
on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shewn into a very pretty room lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley	213.67820739746094
oh	5.7444658279418945
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him	214.30052185058594
darcy made no answer	18.174718856811523
<url> section	18.89744758605957
i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him	54.176963806152344
elizabeth tried to join in her s pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile	88.66490936279297
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane	47.48707962036133
this accounted to elizabeth for mr s being among them	41.11650085449219
mr darcy called and was shut up with him several hours	65.70842742919922
but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happy your affection and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt	138.7849884033203
i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it	42.317283630371094
that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone	89.35428619384766
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it	30.42102813720703
he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably	47.06869125366211
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see mr darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea	193.15725708007812
mamma do the people here <unk> know i am married day	57.37850570678711
you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin	65.97248077392578
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great denial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love	289.1007080078125
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak	81.84142303466797
till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself	123.22210693359375
no it would have been strange if they had	38.64668273925781
chapter viii colonel s manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings	132.5402374267578
he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her	80.94831085205078
<unk> donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make any <unk> concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states	110.56880950927734
how much you must have gone through	28.11130714416504
after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read	70.1382064819336
i have not a doubt of mr s sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only	110.5190200805664
anxiety on s behalf was another prevailing concern and mr s explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost	187.15353393554688
he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can	81.06289672851562
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way	57.553810119628906
he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland	109.75861358642578
it must be an amusing study	25.387981414794922
it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss s in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning	299.5050964355469
those who chose to be idle certainly might	46.98334884643555
they owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him	55.61268615722656
s congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express	94.94865417480469
t keep coughing so kitty for s sake	63.00969314575195
exceed their income	21.101165771484375
some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw any thing of it	56.93378448486328
i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so	44.47213363647461
mr collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said thanking her for every fish he won and apologising if he thought he won too many	174.62890625
elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house mr gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible	229.00633239746094
it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the present and prepare for another disappointment	209.255126953125
s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen	339.2897644042969
she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse	147.70420837402344
your mother insists upon your accepting it	32.838043212890625
indeed you are mistaken madam	22.45182991027832
i never saw any one so shocked	33.18498611450195
a most welcome negative followed the last and her alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme	244.21592712402344
jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention	83.81871795654297
she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself	179.1045379638672
all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes	47.27781677246094
if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar hand it does not advance their felicity in the least	151.5974884033203
she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance	161.9114532470703
oh yes	8.854702949523926
mr bennet had no turn for economy and her s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income	113.0484619140625
you did	12.306750297546387
vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already destined to another	123.7449722290039
cried miss bingley	13.358671188354492
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr darcy chose to doubt or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short any thing or nothing	194.93911743164062
as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination	413.8740234375
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility	107.22954559326172
miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards	36.65125274658203
my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made	186.0403289794922
do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense	68.86807250976562
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life	123.98628997802734
let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers	62.838531494140625
elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her s thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away	119.10003662109375
i am far from attributing any part of mr s conduct to design said elizabeth but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery	142.75242614746094
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant	31.210430145263672
when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish	233.1197509765625
insolent girl	18.749971389770508
thank heaven	15.122293472290039
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north	102.00049591064453
but on returning to the room when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her	154.04904174804688
his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion	106.57096862792969
wickham will never marry a woman without some money	50.681434631347656
chapter x elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could	69.6703872680664
it is every way horrible	35.3807373046875
they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it	80.3222885131836
i often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with s friends	70.15341186523438
i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony	54.00307846069336
when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing farther to wish	61.06394577026367
miss s congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere	81.11964416503906
what could be the meaning of it it was impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know	78.69715118408203
she had even learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary	157.8439178466797
in a few minutes mr bennet half opened the door and called out lizzy my dear i want to speak with you	96.64403533935547
this letter is from mr collins	25.059383392333984
and is such a girl to be my s sister	41.196285247802734
i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her	52.41191101074219
perhaps i do	14.2122220993042
who would have thought she could be so thin and small	49.84564208984375
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure	120.95636749267578
while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner such formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st s	432.7518310546875
you <unk> me for coming	27.452468872070312
and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice	84.93138885498047
oh	5.7444658279418945
in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief	156.67784118652344
that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask	45.930084228515625
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr wickham and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr s looks and behaviour	186.442138671875
i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this	118.99800109863281
but nothing can be done i know very well that nothing can be done	51.73589324951172
mr bennet was quite in the <unk>	23.790531158447266
but let me advise you to think better of it	38.620323181152344
as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of will are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch	326.8030700683594
indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me	96.88907623291016
if you are outside the united states check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before <unk> copying displaying performing distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other project tm work	115.22054290771484
she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her	82.09220123291016
he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected	67.92493438720703
there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again	107.34599304199219
will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again at present i have not room to do them justice	98.16346740722656
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce	238.95184326171875
she then sat still five minutes longer but unable to <unk> such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room	169.9320526123047
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr s charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice	135.47596740722656
but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge	56.679237365722656
the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every s impatience	74.61725616455078
he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others	97.54972839355469
his surprise was great	24.237319946289062
s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sister except mary agreed to go with her and mr collins was to attend them at the request of mr bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither mr collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to mr bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsford	369.7613220214844
jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way	82.17050170898438
it would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two	62.972984313964844
my dear lizzy i wish you joy	20.830665588378906
but we are all liable to error	28.891468048095703
is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring	51.827945709228516
my good qualities are under your protection and you are to <unk> them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last	303.1271667480469
oh	5.7444658279418945
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill used	196.24148559570312
we were married you know at st s because s lodgings were in that parish	67.35201263427734
it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now	73.70072937011719
darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of <unk> them	167.8802032470703
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her s entrance though no request of introduction had been made	80.22434997558594
to the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding mr bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the others	117.6151123046875
how are they even to be discovered	33.47370147705078
his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time	84.05573272705078
i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before	126.33103942871094
he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided	66.69268035888672
mr bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard	378.1991882324219
i depend on you for that	28.37605094909668
i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it	161.0804443359375
i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley	63.92564010620117
the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening	60.897315979003906
it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first	81.90065002441406
i promised them so <unk>	26.151954650878906
repeated mr bennet	15.043238639831543
obstinate headstrong girl	36.162269592285156
did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring	112.94495391845703
i am astonished my dear said mr bennet that you should be so ready to think your own children silly	65.50236511230469
you will not be fit to be seen when you get there	49.98303985595703
and so was i you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner	67.8995590209961
i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat	42.89992904663086
elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph	51.792137145996094
her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so altered	71.6622543334961
we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire	40.89653015136719
as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too	328.60650634765625
did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference	43.74884033203125
elizabeth now began to revive	22.717266082763672
i cannot make him out there is something very pompous in his style and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail we cannot suppose he would help it if he could can he be a sensible man sir	225.20068359375
who should suffer but myself	34.10353088378906
heaven and <unk> of what are you thinking	39.75616455078125
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes	41.08983612060547
yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word	45.836429595947266
pray make haste and come into the room for there is such a sight to be seen	60.352020263671875
but perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design	191.73287963867188
at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but for your sakes we would do any thing	140.73556518554688
wickham perhaps is my favourite but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as s	78.28134155273438
	6.400625228881836
the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter	191.8284149169922
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of felt delight <unk> over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in <unk> of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable	265.39251708984375
i have written to colonel forster to inform him of our present <unk> and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy <unk> for which i have pledged myself	166.109130859375
the moral will be perfectly fair	34.44070816040039
there was no want of discourse	27.98664093017578
if i were as rich as mr darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was	109.20474243164062
i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it	57.47597885131836
in such an exigence my s advice and assistance would be every thing in the world he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness	117.607421875
his disposition must be dreadful	22.700082778930664
the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that s <unk> had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or <unk> in him	161.31358337402344
this was a sad <unk> of what her s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her consent there was still something to be wished for	168.65830993652344
elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight	59.045928955078125
mr gardiner was a sensible like man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education	88.14646911621094
to oblige you i would try to believe almost any thing but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart	200.8621368408203
but these things happen so often	31.595945358276367
i do not get on at all	26.557172775268555
chapter xii as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must <unk> them more	123.17196655273438
but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle	129.7002410888672
for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter	72.53639221191406
s going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her s never intending to go there himself	96.72779083251953
and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false	140.64468383789062
i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point	64.35501861572266
what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant	58.016395568847656
thought she	17.891868591308594
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end	231.97955322265625
chapter xviii s spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her	123.02523040771484
how you must have hated me after that evening	43.363563537597656
this was agreed to and mr philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards	126.20634460449219
the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year	165.7567596435547
society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body	110.38788604736328
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention while she added when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood	293.02899169921875
i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family	130.97230529785156
colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr darcy they had only seen at church	101.1230239868164
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did	146.2874755859375
i should like it beyond any thing	29.322795867919922
whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes	121.67996978759766
why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she did he come at all	70.21631622314453
my dear brother replied mr bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for	58.67591094970703
he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible good humoured lively and i never saw such happy manners so much ease with such perfect good breeding	171.31903076171875
it is highly improper	18.516895294189453
a novel	10.869586944580078
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mr s letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him	171.58592224121094
a great deal of good management depend upon it	36.53318786621094
it is such a spur to s genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind	122.91554260253906
on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable	241.02247619628906
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it	107.42823791503906
you were mr s first choice	27.50135040283203
on both sides it was only assertion	33.31820297241211
on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the <unk> as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all	230.35850524902344
he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse any thing which he condescended to ask	99.84637451171875
you are so strange	15.139679908752441
and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one s and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the <unk>	175.21034240722656
their other engagements were few as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the reach	86.0844497680664
she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man	125.72762298583984
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now	30.27076530456543
all loveliness and goodness as she is	34.46199035644531
i should not mind any thing at all	27.358720779418945
are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this	60.56654739379883
she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another	241.5639190673828
mr s letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what mr bennet sent to mr collins in reply to his last	112.18009948730469
i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man	132.31849670410156
the country said darcy can in general supply but few subjects for such a study	80.92262268066406
mr gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world	118.53507232666016
how unlucky	10.889192581176758
what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here	73.45474243164062
it is admirable	14.605281829833984
of what are you talking	27.650917053222656
i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left so small a collection of books what a delightful library you have at pemberley mr darcy	106.54764556884766
he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister	99.19762420654297
how does georgiana get on darcy	43.157188415527344
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful	97.46710205078125
indeed mr bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to make way for her and live to see her take my place in it	154.36636352539062
her s carriage is regularly ordered for us	41.98146438598633
how wonderfully these sort of things occur	34.62479019165039
mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise	157.9094696044922

her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious	90.78407287597656
mr bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton	42.3677978515625
and i think you will agree with me in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable both on his account and my s	116.8759765625
he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it	43.910247802734375
she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents	141.4934844970703
you are too hasty sir she cried	36.80177307128906
i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy	90.79808044433594
i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction	70.00608825683594
he has not an natured look	33.3045654296875
if his own vanity however did not mislead him he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer	134.0888214111328
recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said sir s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of	132.97039794921875
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds	32.36167907714844
her mind was less difficult to develope	30.306665420532227
my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my s immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour	104.84358215332031
she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend	117.37872314453125
but do not imagine that he is always here so often	47.371158599853516
vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrouled	54.5640754699707
his reception however was of the most flattering kind	45.153602600097656
he was very fond of them	17.763948440551758
i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew mr darcy	182.1704864501953
he <unk> and <unk> and makes love to us all	50.77949142456055
his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr s steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself	183.02655029296875
she saw all the glories of the camp its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young and the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once	223.59312438964844
she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham	72.8757553100586
but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for	59.70726013183594
let me know every thing that i am to know without delay	44.51679611206055
so far each recital confirmed the other	57.62517547607422
are you out of your senses to be accepting this man	50.225040435791016
such a charming man so handsome	26.26348876953125
i have already told her so once by your desire	44.989662170410156
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance	62.24213790893555
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family	40.62150955200195
i should infinitely prefer a book	27.69673728942871
he seldom appeared really animated	34.457523345947266
we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid a reply	79.11286163330078
thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me	53.805240631103516
my dear father she cried come back and write immediately	51.98866653442383
they had all been very used since she last saw her sister	54.71010208129883
she replied in the affirmative	20.996850967407227
to the girls who could not listen to their cousin and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the piece the interval of waiting appeared very long	157.17803955078125
i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age	55.499141693115234
it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers	97.0771255493164
replied kitty it looks just like that man that used to be with him before	92.45460510253906
which will not be yours till after your s decease is all that you may ever be entitled to	82.13040161132812
what is it about	17.39371681213379
it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return	88.2028579711914
elizabeth on her side had much to do	40.537235260009766
for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn	87.87238311767578
never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from consequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings	367.5682373046875
but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance	49.673675537109375
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr that mr darcy might leave the country but that he should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week	203.69540405273438
you deserve no such attention	26.916152954101562
can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand	69.10100555419922
well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the collinses live very comfortable do they	77.89952087402344
mr bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent	130.68605041503906
how should you have liked making sermons	40.77998352050781
you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will <unk> you and so generous that you will always exceed your income	162.88223266601562
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition	276.169921875
they were to be off as soon as possible	31.13363265991211
scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings	81.85676574707031
i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness	155.58444213867188
on the strength of s regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgment the highest opinion	102.97683715820312
give me farther particulars	25.239395141601562
why was he to be the judge	29.68199348449707
well supposing them to be in london	29.414627075195312

as they went down stairs together charlotte said i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza	72.7066650390625
elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion	79.68959045410156
this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire splendid property noble <unk> and extensive patronage	182.88697814941406
are the <unk> of pemberley to be thus <unk>	39.0870246887207
she is a very looking woman	22.704648971557617
we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode	57.29413986206055
to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either	52.83115005493164
mr bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight	49.648101806640625
well	9.100425720214844
ah	7.231865882873535
true	10.356017112731934
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command	140.22903442382812
mr long said so too for i asked her whether you did not	64.77543640136719
you cannot be too much on your guard	30.41828727722168
darcy was fixed in astonishment	26.471689224243164
she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of her	42.53733444213867
my friend has an excellent though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did	92.18065643310547
but it was her business to be and certainly her temper to be happy and all was soon right again	91.28251647949219
i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your set downs	77.46028137207031
i will try again	18.090314865112305
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject	329.8662414550781
were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as s friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me	170.3693389892578
the fee is owed to the owner of the project tm trademark but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation	85.21920013427734
every kind of pride must <unk> from the connection	46.65336227416992
he stood by her however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young s whispering to elizabeth again he walked away	99.27284240722656
pray write instantly and let me understand unless it is for very <unk> reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance	182.96009826660156
mama cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss s as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in s library	169.53607177734375
not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them	104.0998306274414
if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone	60.96394348144531
to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection	50.65555953979492
i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i should be looked at	70.8929443359375
when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room	88.60507202148438
oh	5.7444658279418945
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer mr bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st s	317.4673156738281
in the first place replied mr gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland	63.95664978027344
she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it	139.16885375976562
does he know his real character	32.89724349975586
kitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry	65.02783203125
she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street where mr hurst had a house	177.4281463623047
by mr hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments	177.15731811523438
mr bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together	106.50814819335938
he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him	53.619483947753906
by the author of sense and sensibility	22.831632614135742
but with me it is not so	28.146465301513672
go my dear cried her mother and shew her ladyship about the different walks	59.37615203857422
e if you wish to charge a fee or distribute a project tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement you must obtain permission in writing from both the project gutenberg literary archive foundation and michael hart the owner of the project tm trademark	185.8944549560547
supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin	99.6729736328125
my dear aunt this is being serious indeed	36.05805587768555
yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly	33.71809387207031
jane was so admired nothing could be like it	43.519657135009766
in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere	76.41432189941406
mr darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling	38.71232223510742
i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her	94.89708709716797
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others	77.71908569335938
your <unk> are by no means unlike	44.51194763183594
mr darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house	109.84097290039062
you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew	59.79793167114258
but he paid her not the smallest attention till her s death made her mistress of this fortune	72.38522338867188
she will be down in a moment i dare say	34.61939239501953
when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument	92.52833557128906
i am talking of possibilities charles	41.61520004272461
said she	11.40506362915039
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard	278.6500244140625
when to these recollections was added the developement of s character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful	185.62039184570312
a little bathing would set me up for ever	44.325340270996094
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the place that she might be farther from the door	160.96875
but that is one great difference between us	41.741722106933594
this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them	151.13912963867188
your sister i also watched her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the s scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in an error	276.6028747558594
good gracious	9.208251953125
i am sure there is not on his	26.36064338684082
he takes them now for people of fashion	44.307010650634766
yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had	149.1048583984375
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted	64.32085418701172
printed for t egerton military library whitehall	34.455955505371094
john told us mr darcy was here when you sent for us was it so	74.9756851196289
it was a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground	73.00581359863281
i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your s guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better	101.60982513427734
you have	12.781697273254395
i came to you without a doubt of my reception	34.511497497558594
are they indeed	19.144269943237305
oh yes if one could but go to brighton	50.7414665222168
at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the head quarters	193.7648162841797
but he is an ugly fellow	36.9918098449707
if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you	80.00260925292969
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton	57.2509765625
well well and so mr bingley is coming down sister for mr philips first brought her the news well so much the better	118.74688720703125
his law mr hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year	285.69195556640625
come be quick be quick	38.9483642578125
i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on	60.086849212646484
charles when you build your house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley	75.95559692382812
i am going morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him	97.00030517578125
have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity	48.32548522949219
said he taking the letter from his pocket but perhaps you would like to read it	72.1456298828125
you have a sweet room here mr bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk	93.10673522949219
but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out	76.844482421875
nothing child nothing	21.039276123046875
elizabeth looked archly and turned away	39.27165222167969
yes she called yesterday with her father	34.5526237487793
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his <unk> letter	136.05723571777344
his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal	49.6334228515625
if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chuses before it but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards	201.9345703125
first of all he asked miss lucas	36.877357482910156
lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or <unk> and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even s good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone	224.35972595214844
but lizzy	10.243758201599121
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your s lips instead of your own	91.58179473876953
to mr s acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with <unk> that the subject might never be mentioned to him again	142.92279052734375
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease	78.34150695800781
i am sorry it went off	22.52336883544922
said mr bennet more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own	74.5020980834961
but now that my dear uncle is come i hope every thing will be well	58.817405700683594
if he no longer cares for me why silent	43.39124298095703
can you deny that you have done it	27.758182525634766
lady catherine continued her remarks on s performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste	74.17958068847656
an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure	44.02334213256836
mr bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of	69.33060455322266
and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall <unk> a list according to his information	113.45710754394531
poor dear child	20.18978500366211
mr bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters	50.79546356201172
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was	50.801116943359375
mr collins on his return highly gratified mr bennet by admiring mr s manners and politeness	66.82785034179688
most willingly	16.76044273376465
in her own past behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin	111.7582778930664
but it is so strange	16.720863342285156
mr gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not return it	49.97782897949219
in the evening soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library she saw mr darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme	114.64167785644531
but gracious me	15.839378356933594
they have some of the finest woods in the country	46.326393127441406
lady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given him a living	51.299171447753906
does your charge give you much trouble	44.89926528930664
but however insincere you may choose to be you shall not find me so	55.14688491821289
why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley	55.89753341674805
she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family	165.95919799804688
as they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the parlour and room and <unk> them after a short <unk> to be decent looking rooms walked on	125.93863677978516
she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of mr darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance	248.405029296875
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory	49.19416427612305
in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived	56.201141357421875
that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr darcy	44.44050598144531
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted	47.07890701293945
does she live near you sir	35.3523063659668
i am sorry to say it of them but so it is	42.725433349609375
if he had not had a family of his own i and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him except a few presents	154.98805236816406
said he that is rather singular	36.924217224121094
he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you	200.03262329101562
though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a s deliberation i am not	128.8902587890625
he owns it himself without disguise	37.77211380004883
do let me ask my partner to introduce you	44.410491943359375
and above all things keep mr bennet from fighting	63.80013656616211
it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present	135.01002502441406
i cannot see why mr forster should not ask me as well as lydia said she though i am not her particular friend	92.9482650756836
she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times	140.3236083984375
and so would anne if her health had allowed her to apply	61.12838363647461

dear dear lizzy	17.016874313354492
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor s so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire	298.5033264160156
bingley was every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter	62.17897415161133
or why did he thus come a day before he was expected	58.24668884277344
mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast	28.225845336914062
i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable	91.7608642578125
my dear mr bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that netherfield park is let at last	111.67051696777344
elizabeth was delighted	13.430885314941406
on finding mr bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning	274.2576599121094
i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess with who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i love and he is an angel	160.63299560546875
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again	105.8351821899414
and it was settled that we should all be there by <unk> clock	58.42378234863281
our instrument is a capital one probably superior you shall try it some day do your sisters play and sing	138.845947265625
i am not likely to leave kent for some time	39.38241195678711
his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but she could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again	166.47085571289062
that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her because he does not write with ease	82.17171478271484
but mr gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fears and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters	311.78778076171875
elizabeth privately added and how much i shall have to conceal	46.52375411987305
cried he turning towards her	26.91398811340332
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme	119.06083679199219
i did not think mr gardiner was so little to be trusted	40.369136810302734
i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things	103.88687133789062
s mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view	88.48480224609375
mr s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her s sufferings	80.20417785644531
i know your disposition lizzy	19.561389923095703
it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began	64.56381225585938
on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place	84.20584869384766
they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mr bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of bingley in half an s visit had revived	212.25701904296875
how strange this is	22.996444702148438
was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs	46.47106170654297
of whom does jane ever think ill	47.53805160522461
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes	44.71323013305664
if this be the case he deserves you	35.68837356567383
that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice	102.13041687011719
but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us	50.02873229980469
she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure	401.92132568359375
mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me	44.520076751708984
i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us	42.7403450012207
mary <unk> for the use of the library at netherfield and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter	97.35104370117188
nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and <unk> of my law	133.08079528808594
she supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter	92.19192504882812
as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents	58.336647033691406
elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from <unk> infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied	152.4550018310547
mr hurst looked at her with astonishment	29.16427230834961
i am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully if i should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia	122.85975646972656
at length however the question was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while mr reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him morrow with a large party of friends	130.7724609375
it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man	52.66981506347656
but the clothes the wedding clothes	46.68088912963867
mary was obliged to <unk> more with the world but she could still <unk> over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by <unk> between her beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she <unk> to the change without much <unk>	193.5537567138672
i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had finished her speech	61.7357063293457
it must not be thought of	25.112483978271484
mr collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction	146.3982391357422
elizabeth who knew this to be <unk> at mr darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat	88.56624603271484
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had mr bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all	152.54026794433594
and so darcy did every thing made up the match gave the money paid the s debts and got him his commission	111.77840423583984
they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream	260.3245849609375
perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did not i mention it to you	69.27043151855469
i am most seriously displeased	19.507089614868164
bingley urged mr s being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians	151.1887969970703
oh	5.7444658279418945
there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself	48.62548828125
as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done	140.53916931152344
you write uncommonly fast	24.18010139465332
upon the whole i am much pleased with him	33.56977081298828
their party in the room was large for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news	94.05567932128906
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much <unk> and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements	113.31820678710938
<unk> and <unk> changes have been made so that there is consistency within the book	72.63685607910156
it is mr bingley i am sure	23.061277389526367
see <url> s note	33.80692672729492
they saw much to interest but nothing to justify enquiry	69.56494140625
yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally <unk> without raising all this <unk>	121.39395904541016
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of s leaving home	105.31730651855469
almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life	97.0025634765625
then shewing her purchases	22.327909469604492
from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr s side and as many bows on sir s they departed	126.03466033935547
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name	69.04743957519531
and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out dear am do not go i beg you will not go mr collins must excuse me he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear	190.35227966308594
it is all for s sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then	84.48444366455078
my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you	221.51492309570312
they <unk> it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved	106.23989868164062
but i am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to me they were excessively sorry to go	106.09165954589844
why should they try to influence him	34.7010383605957
my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me	107.22785186767578
his father miss bennet the late mr darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections	182.7083282470703
it was all pride and insolence	34.54458236694336
and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement	60.5405387878418
she got up and ran out of the room and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to the parlour	94.1423110961914
i believe am i may safely promise you never to dance with him	53.99566650390625
if i wished to think slightingly of any s children it should not be of my own however	73.5274658203125

he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity	60.05634689331055
elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her s ruin still more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them	334.8238830566406
we neither of us perform to strangers	46.642601013183594
to be sure london was rather thin but however the little <unk> was open	70.86740112304688
you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him	47.16370391845703
but mr bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish s week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before	168.9960174560547
can it be possible that he will marry her	38.407047271728516
lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her	68.91341400146484
engraved for no of la belle assemblee july pride prejudice chapter i it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife	239.54161071777344
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained	224.79635620117188
the comfort to her of the s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression	66.80168914794922
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the bell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room	112.4223403930664
but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general	75.54632568359375
the hill crowned with wood from which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object	140.24070739746094
the carriage was sent to meet them at and they were to return in it by time	65.48836517333984
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to <unk> with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion	377.6695556640625
when elizabeth had rejoiced over s departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment	107.40643310546875
you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him	49.4447021484375
with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many	196.4747772216797
mr annesley is with her	29.43695831298828
her own thoughts were employing her	25.1082820892334
not yet replied jane	24.624155044555664
i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand s character	89.27262115478516
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly replied why should you be surprised my dear eliza do you think it incredible that mr collins should be able to procure any s good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you	338.39410400390625
you may as well call it impertinence at once	41.91339111328125
she did not choose it said her daughter she would go	49.14784240722656
my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to mr wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant	357.2462158203125
such were the gentle murmurs of mr bennet and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr s continued absence	138.7209930419922
sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine	173.416259765625
the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage	227.57911682128906
her answer therefore was not propitious at least not to s wishes for she was impatient to get home	97.1578140258789
it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the lashes so remarkably fine might be copied	144.64324951171875
it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other s of superior execution	74.40689086914062
mr bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when mr bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was	254.65936279296875
the <unk> was <unk> to a and everybody said they never saw so <unk> a <unk>	75.6240005493164
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention	52.161808013916016
no i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings	61.38539505004883
people do not die of little trifling colds	40.09668731689453
and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment	124.60587310791016
at present i am not in love with mr wickham no i certainly am not	55.21196365356445
what did you say of me that i did not deserve	35.31733703613281
if one could but go to brighton	41.979881286621094
we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes said her mother resentfully since we are not to visit	84.69247436523438
whatever he said was said well and whatever he did done gracefully	70.68317413330078
but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood	107.62980651855469
they insist also on my seeing mr therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to and excepting a throat and ache there is not much the matter with me	158.98765563964844
he comes down on thursday at the <unk> very likely on wednesday	65.50881958007812
i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news	50.905845642089844
if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to think	74.23188018798828
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her s ready acquiescence	70.447021484375
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern	40.129032135009766
no indeed	14.158703804016113
you go to brighton i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds	112.57856750488281
i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere	47.44085693359375
that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him	113.61650848388672
a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh	56.508575439453125
there is nothing the matter with me	29.34602165222168
such very superior dancing is not often seen	52.45546340942383
as it was certain however that somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the <unk> of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the shrubbery	133.393310546875
and upon s seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing mr collins	127.49397277832031
he should be particularly happy at any time c	41.049346923828125
bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations	44.946563720703125
oh	5.7444658279418945
i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied	88.46747589111328
she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all	56.54753875732422
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy	40.49816131591797
really mr collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly	76.2472152709961
chapter xix the next day opened a new scene at longbourn	44.347190856933594
she enquired into s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as s and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry	287.8902587890625
i quite detest the man	24.403039932250977
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added how long did you say that he was at rosings	72.58419799804688
she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham	94.08780670166016
consider how important every moment is in such a case	45.21943283081055
he owed a good deal in the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable	69.23827362060547
not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did mr bennet give up the point	83.23799133300781
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her	73.22393798828125
well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home	70.52452087402344
she really looked almost wild	27.88473129272461
the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense	249.03176879882812
she was not rendered formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her importance and brought mr wickham immediately to s mind and from the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented	210.11746215820312
his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partner in his pleasure	191.31961059570312
it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire	39.027835845947266
mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he poor eliza to be only just tolerable	95.9996109008789
jane resolutely kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the she looked she saw mr darcy with him and sat down again by her sister	151.6544952392578
the park was very large and contained great variety of ground	64.41996002197266
no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you	65.26114654541016
vol iii london	20.072532653808594
i do not know who is good enough for him	33.16286849975586
in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the sight of each other	59.30927658081055
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not and from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before	108.08705139160156
can it be really so	24.05738067626953
i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from <unk> my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married	178.65081787109375
how nicely we are crammed in	28.2297420501709
said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam	27.93631362915039
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages mr darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all	160.22683715820312
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters	64.02062225341797
but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed	99.64661407470703
she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her	80.73307800292969
what could your ladyship propose by it	29.161678314208984
i shall offer to pay him morrow he will <unk> and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter	97.7008056640625
could i expect it to be otherwise	31.275161743164062
elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no woman walking was her only alternative	132.17355346679688
it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention	67.83956909179688
we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydia elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together	130.0391082763672
but that gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing at all	68.82329559326172
the prospect of such delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits	58.34027862548828
it was not all settled before monday	31.52168846130371
on the s appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance	155.0904998779297
mr wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia	96.00117492675781
you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous	63.21653747558594
he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while	70.02379608154297
very and this offer of marriage you have refused	54.77538299560547
what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer	378.9470520019531
in three volumes	14.21401596069336
said he hastily as he opened the door	33.99361038208008
i do not believe mr long will do any such thing	40.01207733154297
i expected to find a more reasonable young woman	39.124351501464844
it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many generations	61.965023040771484
a flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite	226.05044555664062
however little mr darcy might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer	221.51011657714844
you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you all	62.24844741821289
she does not yet leave her room	35.49372863769531
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man	98.06611633300781
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth	76.72120666503906
elizabeth equally next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course	60.09642028808594
but she is too much like her brother very very proud as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement	174.97535705566406
i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory <unk> of particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write	165.38787841796875
yet why did he come	26.241756439208984
i speak nothing but the truth	29.927629470825195
you are a s daughter	23.506803512573242
she will make him a very proper wife	40.15182876586914
it is a pity they are not handsome	24.883384704589844
all s anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again	214.43064880371094
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia but while they were supported by their s indulgence what chance could there be of improvement	155.9547119140625
you do not know what i suffer	21.356285095214844
they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine	72.19017028808594
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly	47.244564056396484
there is one point on which i want your advice	47.20499801635742
your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with	110.6033935546875
he arranges the business just as he pleases	34.60961151123047
certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it	260.8898620605469
those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry as mr forster called her and they were going to the camp and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be for her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public	501.14642333984375
i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for any thing more	97.35608673095703
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you	244.50819396972656
as for your s picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes	99.74504089355469
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening	81.48702239990234
sometimes	13.291082382202148
by s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take <unk> with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself	152.7469024658203
i desire you will do no such thing	28.742338180541992
but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their <unk> were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture	132.61282348632812
mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached	166.52980041503906
if we are ever able to learn what s debts have been said elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own	214.35719299316406
upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself	81.55978393554688
only think of its being three months she cried since i went away it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things enough happened in the time	163.0010986328125
i have every reason in the world to think ill of you	43.0458869934082
in what an amiable light does this place him	48.51604080200195
mr bennet was really in a most pitiable state	43.5833854675293
illustration	7.884949684143066
mr bennet said only nonsense nonsense	27.222402572631836
on saturday he came again	26.287948608398438
miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful	119.26931762695312
could colonel forster repeat the particulars of s note to his wife	61.198326110839844
unfeeling selfish girl	25.91830825805664
i will only add god bless you	53.242916107177734
i see your design bingley said his friend you dislike an argument and want to silence this	79.25685119628906
she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room	51.0291633605957
it was to this effect	18.90468406677246
you have no compassion on my poor nerves	31.02896499633789
have you had any flirting	27.299758911132812
but his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited	358.82666015625
i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr s regard	56.03074264526367
they may be <unk> and printed and given you may do <unk> anything with public domain ebooks	93.97635650634766
i am very glad you liked her	24.830780029296875
exceedingly well	16.959083557128906
miss bennet accepted her s invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time than as she hoped that by s not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him	222.70643615722656
mr collins made his declaration in form	34.29541015625
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side	64.65486907958984
shall you like to have such a brother	32.965938568115234
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to mr darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance mr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained	825.7839965820312
the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground	85.60279083251953
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage	43.50411605834961
by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song	166.268798828125
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks	140.38754272460938
pray do not talk of that odious man	31.818607330322266
i could not have parted with you my lizzy to any one less worthy	75.74471282958984
she would be in s way you know in that part of the house	46.860042572021484
mr bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity of detaining them	151.95277404785156
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself	285.1000061035156
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment	24.937297821044922
mr gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss s visit in street and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance	204.6459503173828
oh lizzy	9.212966918945312
and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books	66.28414916992188
in spite of having been at st s sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look	253.6790313720703
s spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr s invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the s amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dance	340.16107177734375
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph	44.83725357055664
i wonder what he can be doing there	32.90058517456055
the moment of her release from him was ecstacy	44.9326286315918
good bye	14.645835876464844
but so they always are	24.684494018554688
pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to <unk> me from <unk> i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park	173.91629028320312
they found mr bennet still up	28.192028045654297
to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not s countenance for his features are perfectly good	119.38727569580078
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object	47.84193420410156
i told mr collins so before you came	34.63858413696289
no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both	95.62577819824219
mr philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that mr denny had brought him from london and that he was to have a s commission in the shire	299.7435302734375
young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even your <unk> to discover the name of your admirer	136.56411743164062
there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men	62.68753433227539
her face is too thin her complexion has no brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome	110.91058349609375
mr collins awkward and solemn apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give	154.17315673828125
he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us	192.47216796875
i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy	74.26512908935547
all was joy and kindness	30.921415328979492
yes am all	19.8342227935791
i never heard any thing so abominable	24.053565979003906
lady catherine seemed pleased	19.275821685791016
it was not till the afternoon when he joined them at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say nothing of that	174.95738220214844
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect	211.67916870117188
lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all	71.8258285522461
but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity	66.49861907958984
wickham passed all his youth there you know	51.36175537109375
section	11.028621673583984
we all love to <unk> though we can teach only what is not worth knowing	76.30424499511719
dear sir i must trouble you once more for congratulations	66.50788879394531
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very <unk> gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances	260.22918701171875
through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance	155.46058654785156
when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him	191.31228637695312
they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned	118.77748107910156
this is a parade cried he which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune	86.35334777832031
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned	53.69935989379883
and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good added kitty	64.92438507080078
elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them an hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down stairs from her s apartment immediately met her	133.3955841064453
it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single	70.51094818115234
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer	149.4657745361328
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said nothing	47.84872055053711
she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas	37.14995574951172
what is mr darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him	54.06680679321289
a person may be proud without being vain	44.463653564453125
had i known what i ought what i dared to do	46.32941818237305
a novel	10.869586944580078
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing she was still dear to him	132.26463317871094
and what arts did he use to separate them	51.21746063232422
no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a s mind	164.68797302246094
he heard her attentively and then said lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances	231.0234832763672
the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question	268.63720703125
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in s park when he put his letter into her hand	94.71227264404297
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for mr collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence	209.8004150390625
nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth	52.275760650634766
pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state	190.44842529296875
i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday	47.62630844116211
you may depend upon my seeking no further	52.388389587402344
you supposed more than really existed	50.03937530517578
the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention	61.488792419433594
s voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and she ran into the room	82.55799102783203
i cannot think so very ill of wickham	29.053646087646484
to be sure that did seem as if he admired indeed i rather believe he did i heard something about but i hardly know something about mr robinson	144.4315948486328
i saw them the night before last	36.042694091796875
i like them prodigiously	29.14129066467285
her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented	191.31260681152344
the <unk> or <unk> of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining <unk>	60.82538986206055
chapter xii elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes	69.98656463623047
it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy	235.73020935058594
i had not thought mr darcy so bad as though i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of i had supposed him to be despising his creatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this	284.6585388183594
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him	186.68508911132812
nothing could console and nothing appease her nor did that day wear out her resentment	90.05803680419922
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt	33.42680358886719
she is happy then said her father drily and her residence there will probably be of some duration	100.70738983154297
they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough wood which bordered it	347.9416198730469
to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment i cannot blame myself for having done thus much	140.58287048339844
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think any thing wanting	72.94397735595703
it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully <unk> as s seems to have been	101.06591033935547
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas	38.681663513183594
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure	46.35917282104492
and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well	165.1798553466797
he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself	111.67130279541016
his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself s happiness and his own would be speedily secured	189.67718505859375
wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable	76.84770202636719
i am not at all afraid of her dying	34.589054107666016
their powers of conversation were considerable	31.767492294311523
such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but for to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined	226.5861358642578
cried bingley	11.699363708496094
they are wanted in the farm mr bennet are not they	55.40970230102539
as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner	77.75401306152344
i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed	57.35932540893555
he was a tall heavy looking young man of five and twenty	48.61220932006836
we now come to the point	28.52320098876953
but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company	158.4217987060547
but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness	196.489501953125
no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all night	91.67963409423828
i am afraid you do not like your pen	28.282634735107422
s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of accents you who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right	301.9864501953125
the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger	48.88704299926758
not perhaps of neglecting his own interest	39.269229888916016
no no this is not likely	30.821422576904297
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced	142.15585327148438
they have at least that advantage	29.744720458984375
the miss webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as s do you draw	92.06240844726562
only look at her	22.000314712524414
they are all for what they can get	36.85852813720703
the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic	50.7369499206543
and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart	87.90825653076172
such a countenance such manners	31.930795669555664
mr darcy you cannot deny the fact	32.148990631103516
my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion	64.55364990234375
the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this	152.24661254882812
i must go instantly to my mother she cried	39.92073059082031
mr wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligible gallantry	159.16458129882812
mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street	164.8368682861328
you have <unk> me in every possible method	36.231624603271484
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this	56.23511505126953
stop me whilst you can	29.852909088134766
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery	90.77080535888672
his words seemed to imply it	28.402441024780273
mr s expectations were fully answered	26.348220825195312
it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions	82.81503295898438
very well that reply will do for the present perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones but now we may be silent	152.06402587890625
yes very well	13.23518180847168
little more than half a s journey	35.2678108215332
what do you mean	11.823322296142578
i want to talk very seriously	27.44451141357422
you provide in accordance with paragraph f a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and <unk> to you within days of receipt of the work	169.7611846923828
she went on	14.514093399047852
elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head	74.45832061767578
morrow fortnight	24.469802856445312
yes almost every day	24.816984176635742
did you on reading it give any credit to its contents	58.411048889160156
but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival of jane	130.29103088378906
that among his own connections he was esteemed and that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling	164.2679901123047
after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropt	45.37910461425781
put them next to your great uncle the judge	55.44600296020508
undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation	124.4944076538086
it adds even another motive	41.640804290771484
in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with mr hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london	100.24777221679688
yes	7.694679260253906
he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it	133.07534790039062
chapter xix had s opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort	112.8219223022461
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld	48.41657638549805
what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are	71.71847534179688
my sisters may write to me	23.91303062438965
it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world	75.05365753173828
what could become of mr bingley and jane	28.82535743713379
i am not one and twenty	20.974132537841797
dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered	48.89723587036133
lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind	92.95398712158203
but does lydia know nothing of this	29.067556381225586
or images of the original pages are available through internet archive	61.90088653564453
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day	406.8170471191406
he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy a most intimate confidential friend	77.39763641357422
mr bingley followed his advice	23.9066162109375
but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so judged a direction of talents talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife	273.6133728027344
but is it certain absolutely certain	28.08601951599121
my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said charlotte	60.51033401489258
repeated elizabeth in utter amazement	28.616090774536133
miss bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room	113.12362670898438
and what am i to do on the occasion it seems an hopeless business	66.03715515136719
these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner watching the sentinel on guard and dressing a sallad and cucumber	133.73731994628906
she is so fond of mr forster said she it will be quite shocking to send her away	77.06970977783203
mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affectionately taking her hand said in reply do not make yourself uneasy my love	112.07160186767578
how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love	59.05047607421875
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did	175.7830047607422
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys	164.7564697265625
they are not married nor can i find there was any intention of being so but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side i hope it will not be long before they are	156.8010711669922
colonel forster will i dare say do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head	68.25312042236328
she could think of nothing else and yet whether s regard had really died away or were suppressed by his interference whether he had been aware of s attachment or whether it had escaped his observation whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her s situation remained the same her peace equally wounded	349.96197509765625
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in	32.6505126953125
every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites	353.48077392578125
wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her	133.1393280029297
they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mr s civilities	143.8436279296875
if i have wounded your s feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured mr wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family	277.6783142089844
she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night	70.80400085449219
they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them	53.62546157836914
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on	115.87264251708984
it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr bennet and nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn	113.26976013183594
i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to him	53.84587097167969
mr gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces	95.76055908203125
mr bingley was good looking and like he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected manners	91.44731140136719
s note	13.681304931640625
information about the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the project gutenberg literary archive foundation is a <unk> profit <unk> <unk> <unk> under the laws of the state of <unk> and <unk> tax exempt status by the <unk> <unk> service	115.3968734741211
is not this an agreeable surprise	36.75326919555664
to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures	88.76569366455078
s misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention	76.50565338134766
for forty years he produced and distributed project tm ebooks with only a loose <unk> of <unk> support	125.02162170410156
what a letter is this to be written at such a moment	43.96220779418945
in a fortnight they were to go and once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account	95.42095947265625
they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea	97.33403778076172
seriously however she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that s concurrence	103.91461944580078
cried elizabeth	8.131646156311035
it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends	81.6153335571289
she added by far too much	30.04208755493164
mr bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast	71.2018051147461
mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public	42.832984924316406
i hope we may often meet again	30.60429573059082
make haste make haste	22.433109283447266
i had once some thoughts of fixing in town for i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas	139.09144592285156
you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner	57.47589874267578
the old lady is mr jenkinson who lives with them	54.407413482666016
why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear	93.8429183959961
the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light	144.11883544921875
i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading	48.06037139892578
she answered him in the usual way and after a s pause added my eldest sister has been in town these three months	86.6857681274414
oh yes they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland	113.6376953125
so much the better	17.862825393676758
bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed	121.81800842285156
i am afraid mr darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes	98.74980926513672
i do think mr long is as good a creature as ever and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome	124.28791046142578
she comes to us day	23.154434204101562
i can recal nothing worse	23.75027847290039
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply	77.95185089111328
what a contrast between him and his friend	32.68110656738281
and who knows what may happen	29.67215347290039
the letter shall certainly be <unk> if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely <unk> they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that <unk>	188.48330688476562
ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it	82.60350799560547
i am sorry to pain but so it was	35.237693786621094
mr darcy	9.802186965942383
find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer	203.04867553710938
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on mr s leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help saying oh	209.57583618164062
has your governess left you	27.47178077697754
i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future	94.96743774414062
of mr collins and lizzy	22.01799774169922
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him	74.17675018310547
elizabeth immediately began playing again	26.609909057617188
said jane as she finished it	26.24778938293457
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him	189.9612274169922
he now wished it more than ever	30.629301071166992
in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both him and herself	149.78970336914062
their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five and twenty years ago	114.48535919189453
my object then replied darcy was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to	191.34251403808594
elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr darcy	33.952335357666016
for s sake say no more of his partners	55.32145309448242
there was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake	131.80447387695312
very much	11.11335563659668
do not repeat what i then said	41.743019104003906
	6.400625228881836
indeed he has no improper pride	31.461652755737305
kitty run down and order the carriage	46.65922927856445
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not with any certainty	94.83528900146484
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at longbourn	142.9751434326172
i shall send this by express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer	83.98702239990234
it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again	108.01224517822266
mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it mr bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to purchase	388.7239685058594
elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family	75.16871643066406
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement	104.78398895263672
my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many s do	119.50886535644531
you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you	53.732933044433594
he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered s intentions	248.52511596679688
mr bennet could hardly comprehend it	25.00870704650879
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mr philips the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter	162.8882293701172
mr darcy bowed	12.981121063232422
i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence	268.82586669921875
charlotte says she hardly ever does	35.65031433105469
i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point	75.5011978149414
is he married or single	31.01373291015625
she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee <unk> himself and she seized the opportunity of saying is your sister at pemberley still	111.14706420898438
what none of you	20.829059600830078
you have delighted us long enough	29.04375457763672
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself	97.55286407470703
i know not miss elizabeth said he whether mr collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it	155.95175170898438
for my part mr bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up differently	104.71366119384766
your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications	90.01558685302734
she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther	85.03612518310547
well well said he do not make yourself unhappy	37.4201774597168
who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him	87.90079498291016
and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose	38.80187225341797
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever	94.9940185546875
their situation was awkward enough but s she thought was still worse	61.3817138671875
added elizabeth safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune	53.876956939697266
i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe	143.61895751953125
do you not know that such a report is spread abroad	38.73194122314453
depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all	65.88053131103516
write to me very often my dear	37.534996032714844
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem	115.11470031738281
it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence a most country town indifference to decorum	97.3143310546875
let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr s using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner	222.1156005859375
but if otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment	389.4913330078125
mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies and sir william to s high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way	179.70875549316406
general information about project tm electronic works	39.37324523925781
elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible	135.2226104736328
my youngest of all is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds walking with a young man who i believe will soon become a part of the family	128.5020751953125
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning	74.53215789794922
shocking	13.375961303710938
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude	68.6513900756836
i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming	70.63035583496094
she related the subject of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain	73.14411926269531
and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away	67.29603576660156
he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle	51.78835678100586
and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men	218.8394317626953
but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well	57.20197677612305
mr darcy who was leaning against the piece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise	116.2557373046875
no i should have turned in a moment	33.395912170410156
on entering the room she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book	207.6201934814453
kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them ill	66.63043975830078
if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable	90.84062194824219
catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to london	163.04974365234375
such a disappointment	18.495805740356445
it had come with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham	145.3478240966797
eliza bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say it succeeds	168.0387725830078
i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return	136.90699768066406
their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recal them	146.437255859375
lydia was lydia still <unk> <unk> wild noisy and <unk>	53.63640213012695
what sort of a girl is miss darcy	36.55083465576172
may i ask to what these questions tend	60.8756103515625
i do not remember her name among the ladies at court	53.986061096191406
i understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriage	45.29555130004883
it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water in one of its narrowest parts	227.56712341308594
oh	5.7444658279418945
it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened	80.66747283935547
where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil	113.91468048095703
my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not	69.97692108154297
what do you mean hill	16.40088653564453
it ought to be so it must be so while he <unk> the use of his reason	69.97468566894531
miss darcy on her s entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side	184.9492645263672
you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt	217.34625244140625
yours c	10.810235977172852
all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry	49.28765106201172
only think of that my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time	107.811767578125
do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place	47.73916244506836
lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford	61.74669647216797
mr collins knew not what to make of him	37.08674621582031
it is impossible that he should still love me	33.32735061645508
they were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them	61.419044494628906
is she handsome	17.006786346435547
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay oxford blenheim warwick kenelworth birmingham c	154.12681579589844
it is a nice long walk and mr darcy has never seen the view	54.440277099609375
you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves	84.0967025756836
i did not wink at you	22.177711486816406
see h htm or h zip	45.85929870605469
you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer	46.9412841796875
what am i to do	22.19920539855957
by the author of sense and sensibility	22.831632614135742
i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal	122.41244506835938
i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a studier of character	80.25373077392578
if i had been able said she to carry my point of going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her	168.2543182373047
it is no such thing	18.502838134765625
your ladyship has declared it to be impossible	33.48344802856445
the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again	184.3855438232422
mr darcy danced only once with mr hurst and once with miss bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party	157.3617401123047
we acted with the best intentions	28.17586898803711
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections	99.83900451660156
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world	50.65117263793945
but perhaps he could not in her s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt	68.33385467529297
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room	115.54679870605469
the gentlemen arrived early and before mr bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out	196.22970581054688
mr bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well against staying longer however elizabeth was positively nor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow mr s carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made	480.4282531738281
it was then disclosed in the following manner	28.339622497558594
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mr s means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband	189.39805603027344
mr bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty and more than once during dinner did mr bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth i am glad you are come back lizzy	165.01422119140625
if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor	217.17909240722656
but of course she did not mention my name to you	39.440853118896484
she blushed and jane blushed but the cheeks of the two who <unk> their confusion suffered no variation of colour	91.95375061035156
yes do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley	75.361328125
and may i ask	21.334644317626953
the vague and unsettled suspicions which <unk> had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her s match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true	260.0067443847656
believe her to be deceived by all means	38.67255401611328
i suspected as much replied elizabeth	29.02962875366211
could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts	44.592010498046875
my uncle is to send a servant for us	35.6590690612793
but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity	154.13650512695312
my mother means well but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she says	90.36861419677734
you mistake me my dear	21.079200744628906
elizabeth you are not serious now	32.758644104003906
they could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same	70.60253143310547
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible	451.8692321777344
their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency	79.12458801269531
amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life	284.6255798339844
you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of it	72.95037078857422
for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my s will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions	221.05738830566406
he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself	100.84619140625
it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage	86.32559967041016
what do you mean mr bennet by talking in this way	38.97284698486328
they must have seen them together for ever	31.15712547302246
it cannot be	13.442480087280273
in the hall they parted	23.20400047302246
how could i ever think her like her nephew	45.209224700927734
bingley met them with hopes that mr bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected	66.66374206542969
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour	160.03591918945312
is that his design in settling here	47.84125900268555
i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford	61.47455978393555
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior	137.39508056640625
the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added <unk> to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be <unk>	202.52099609375
into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance	54.570159912109375
what is there of good to be expected	33.42426681518555
the strangeness of mr s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted	98.02770233154297
it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do	257.01666259765625
i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together	126.45052337646484
mr darcy is not to be laughed at	27.395750045776367
never since reading s second letter had she entertained a hope of s meaning to marry her	82.35205841064453
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no <unk> in future to the impudence of an <unk> man	148.7047119140625
do not imagine miss bennet that your <unk> will ever be gratified	51.647865295410156
i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation	236.0748291015625
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well bred and agreeable	123.44701385498047
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not	54.776180267333984
our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money	133.7928924560547
lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer	212.9619903564453
who would have thought it	22.8499755859375
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley	61.41873550415039
calling back the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and mistress home instantly	192.63037109375
in the next room is a new instrument just come down for a present from my master she comes here morrow with him	98.33916473388672
but georgiana would not join her	29.887441635131836
she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before	78.08537292480469
there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us	57.626346588134766
after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful	57.702110290527344
perhaps other people have said so before but not one with such justice	78.69740295410156
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia	228.38328552246094
my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a s education	157.6690673828125
she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give what shall i call it	90.29241943359375
he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield she a beauty i should as soon call her mother a wit but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time	399.8637390136719
lizzy said he what are you doing	33.701805114746094
heaven forbid	15.489919662475586
but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon	85.04325103759766
yes miss bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all	103.45991516113281
i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong	60.2441520690918
they were in street	16.899492263793945
i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by her s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings	111.05603790283203
you take an eager interest in that s concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour	101.05807495117188
one of them does	22.408245086669922
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt	65.91609954833984
as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go	341.32861328125
pray go to see them with sir william and maria	43.80081558227539
were it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr collins very but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you	126.38671875
and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again	166.86053466796875
elizabeth felt s pleasure	25.044452667236328
i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me	235.76315307617188
tis too much	14.703276634216309
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in farther justification of mr darcy she could not but allow that mr bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits	600.8248291015625
when i went away i felt that it would soon happen	44.63138961791992
you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project tm license when you share it without charge with others	173.4037322998047
a place too with which so many of your acquaintance are connected	61.10070037841797
after discharging his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady catherine he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men	536.0944213867188
come darcy said he i must have you dance	47.02765655517578
and i have another favour to ask	36.930908203125
my aunt she continued is going morrow into that part of the town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in street	86.03528594970703
till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance	55.222625732421875
a lively imagination soon settled it all	36.29503631591797
elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying	101.76589965820312
how good it was in you my dear mr bennet	38.476097106933594
mr s behaviour astonished and vexed her	34.137332916259766
i advise mr darcy and lizzy and kitty said mr bennet to walk to <unk> mount this morning	83.966796875
very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody	180.77577209472656
good gracious	9.208251953125
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane	117.9112548828125
s affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to s for him	77.7220687866211
i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice	51.78085708618164
you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this in such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion	103.27364349365234
she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked	90.4968032836914
they will have nothing else to do	25.541500091552734
i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron	110.8643798828125
they were of course all intending to be surprised but their astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of mr bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even inferior to what elizabeth felt	151.9508819580078
it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother but at the same time mr bingley it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me	133.27088928222656
chapter xiv during dinner mr bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness	196.92739868164062
at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion	104.44406127929688
this match to which you have the presumption to <unk> can never take place	74.93080139160156
my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better	57.551753997802734
you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty	54.07638168334961
but of this answer lydia heard not a word	45.26019287109375
perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease	114.28214263916016
i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is likely to be in this country much longer	79.11060333251953
his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an natured tone that she wished they might be happy	144.01625061035156
its <unk> depended on others	31.46245765686035
on the following monday mr bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn	101.0977554321289
since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and <unk> a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been his design	166.6408233642578
i have not been accustomed to such language as this	57.374671936035156
her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town and by that means as i told lady catherine myself one day has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament	234.59317016601562
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance	137.99118041992188
about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mr younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement	477.75946044921875
in the intervals of her discourse with mr collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to mr collins was a very genteel pretty kind of girl	177.384033203125
tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss s	171.17303466796875
d the copyright laws of the place where you are located also <unk> what you can do with this work	110.48487854003906
the humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern	554.9912719726562
no not at all	18.469205856323242
you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged	84.71167755126953
dear lizzy	11.20588493347168
no more have i said mr bennet and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you	79.02576446533203
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a bred man and talked very pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mr collins sat for some time without speaking to any body	200.7532501220703
as the day of his arrival drew near i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister	100.18479919433594
but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane	53.184173583984375
mr bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss s witticisms on fine eyes	209.5839385986328
why must she be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold	83.04804229736328
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty	145.980712890625
after sitting a little while with jane on miss s appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour	118.54938507080078
chapter xi when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared	266.5068664550781
of this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with	158.8485107421875
this cannot be	14.878960609436035
lakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation	220.3493194580078
her liveliness had been never worse timed	56.73780822753906
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile	32.911338806152344
mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain	94.53845977783203
your reproof so well applied i shall never forget	46.125816345214844
her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating	54.42120361328125
not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room	156.25917053222656
perhaps that is not possible for any one	36.35660934448242
only think what an establishment it would be for one of them	62.743350982666016
all connection between us seemed now dissolved	43.9234733581543
when mr bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn	156.40060424804688
mr bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner	96.44265747070312
design	14.23079776763916
you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be <unk> from it	115.7468032836914
but you know married women have never much time for writing	55.04751968383789
you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy	140.48008728027344
do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody	64.87739562988281
she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and naturedly engaged mr s conversation to herself	97.25830078125
at last it arrested and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her	132.3406982421875
but i dare not hope it	25.214088439941406
general terms of use and redistributing project tm electronic works a by reading or using any part of this project tm electronic work you <unk> that you have read understand agree to and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property agreement	184.84361267089844
when you told mr bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else	280.7855224609375
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her	140.94039916992188
cried maria after a few minutes silence it seems but a day or two since we first came and yet how many things have happened	116.0702896118164
he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london	54.418460845947266
and do you really know all this	29.34173011779785
is there one among the sex who would not <unk> against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman	110.93091583251953
his affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend	158.1492156982422
she will drop the acquaintance entirely	34.11454772949219
this cannot be engaged to mr darcy	25.948556900024414
oh	5.7444658279418945
i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted	90.60710144042969
oh yes that that is the worst of all	35.60992431640625
to mr darcy it was welcome elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough	55.27033996582031
how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls	97.53588104248047
if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy	65.42428588867188
colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman	110.64027404785156
at length however our kind friend procured the for direction	51.78763961791992
from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr collins and i will never see you again if you do	130.26327514648438
they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of s perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for <unk> the excellent understanding and excellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself	401.1814270019531
but you do not know all	20.5273494720459
miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in any thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives	120.98931884765625
would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again	147.84805297851562
my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be	83.03727722167969
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to ask of the former	96.4093246459961
but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked	123.17137908935547
they were therefore to go elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply	102.16339111328125
interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other	45.98749923706055
cried elizabeth	8.131646156311035
with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round	77.86367797851562
elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her s behaviour as a husband	59.680904388427734
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way	125.91236114501953
but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards every one had been scarcely ever clouded	214.70150756835938
she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley	79.98290252685547
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression	34.45860290527344
they were ignorant idle and vain	30.01045799255371
send back your answer as soon as you can and be careful to write explicitly	96.22247314453125
a few weeks he believed	25.716615676879883
