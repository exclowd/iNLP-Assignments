yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the city arms hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his <unk> to make himself interesting for that old <unk> mrriordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest <unk> ever was actually afraid to lay out d for her <unk> spirit telling me all her <unk> she had too much old chat in her about politics and <unk> and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first god help the world if all the women were her sort down on <unk> and <unk> of course nobody wanted her to wear them i suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice i hope ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a <unk> woman certainly and her <unk> talk about mrriordan here and mrriordan there i suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always <unk> to get up under my petticoats especially then still i like that in him polite to old women like that and <unk> and <unk> too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but i suppose id have to <unk> it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as im not yes because theyre so weak and <unk> when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose <unk> youd think it was o <unk> and that <unk> one off the south circular when he <unk> his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf mountain the day i wore that dress miss <unk> bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a <unk> bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides i hate <unk> and <unk> when he cut his toe with the razor <unk> his corns afraid hed get <unk> but if it was a thing i was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it <unk> it hynes kept me who did i meet ah yes i met do you remember menton and who else who let me see that big <unk> i saw him and he not long married <unk> with a young girl at <unk> <unk> and turned my back on him when he <unk> out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the <unk> to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big <unk> i ever met and thats called a solicitor only for i hate having a long <unk> in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as i do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when i came into the front room to show him <unk> death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a <unk> in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to <unk> any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that i care two <unk> now who he does it with or knew before that way though id like to find out so long as i dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that <unk> that mary we had in <unk> terrace <unk> out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice i had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when i found the long hair on his coat without that one when i went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course <unk> servants then <unk> that she could eat at our table on christmas day if you please o no thank you not in my house <unk> my potatoes and the oysters per <unk> going out to see her aunt if you please common <unk> so it was but i was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof o yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but i told her what i thought of her <unk> me to go out to be alone with her i wouldnt lower myself to <unk> on them the garters i found in her room the friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when i gave her her weeks notice i saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself <unk> only for the damn <unk> and throwing out the dirt i gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house i couldnt even touch him if i thought he was with a dirty <unk> liar and <unk> like that one <unk> it up to my face and singing about the place in the w c too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the <unk> in my hand there <unk> another i just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young may moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said im <unk> out and going to the gaiety though im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case god knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless i paid some <unk> boy to do it since i cant do it myself a young boy would like me id <unk> him a little alone with him if we were id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him <unk> him i know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that <unk> drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the <unk> yes with a bishop yes i would because i told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews <unk> gardens when i was <unk> that <unk> thing a stranger to dublin what place was it and so on about the <unk> and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german <unk> is it yes imagine im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply <unk> for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and <unk> him first you sometimes love to <unk> when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself i wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost <unk> you then i hate that confession when i used to go to father <unk> he touched me father and what harm if he did where and i said on the canal bank like a fool but <unk> on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes o lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it i forget no father and i always think of the real father what did he want to know for when i already confessed it to god he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always i wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he id say by the <unk> in his <unk> i wonder did he know me in the box i could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them id like to be <unk> by one in his <unk> and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to h h the pope for a penance i wonder was he satisfied with me one thing i didnt like his <unk> me behind going away so <unk> in the hall though i laughed im not a horse or an ass am i i suppose he was thinking of his fathers i wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am i in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the <unk> kind of paste they stick their bills up with some <unk> id like to <unk> those <unk> green and yellow expensive drinks those <unk> <unk> drink with the opera hats i <unk> once with my finger dipped out of that american that had the <unk> talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because i felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment i popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up god be merciful to us i thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when i blessed myself and said a hail mary like those awful <unk> in gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no god what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of <unk> the candle i lit that evening in <unk> street chapel for the month of may see it brought its luck though hed <unk> if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when i lit the lamp because he must have come or times with that <unk> big red brute of a thing he has i thought the vein or whatever the <unk> they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after i took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and <unk> and <unk> it like iron or some kind of a thick <unk> standing all the time he must have eaten oysters i think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no i never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a <unk> driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined <unk> look in his eye i had to <unk> my eyes still he <unk> such a <unk> amount of spunk in him when i made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time i let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what i went through with milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and mina <unk> husband give us a swing out of your <unk> <unk> her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called <unk> or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it <unk> the child is a black the last time i was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like <unk> or i dont know what supposing i <unk> having another not off him though still if he was married im sure hed have a fine strong child but i dont know poldy has more spunk in him yes <unk> be awfully jolly i suppose it was meeting josie powell and the funeral and thinking about me and boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if <unk> do him any good i know they were <unk> a bit when i came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of georgina <unk> <unk> and then he wanted to <unk> it down my neck it was on account of not <unk> to see her a <unk> that was why we had the <unk> row over politics he began it not me when he said about our lord being a <unk> at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything i was <unk> with myself after for giving in only for i knew he was gone on me and the first <unk> he said he was he <unk> me so much i couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of <unk> things especially about the body and the inside i often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician i could always hear his voice talking when the room was <unk> and watch him after that i <unk> i had a <unk> on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and i said over to floey and he made me the present of <unk> <unk> and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that i could quite easily get him to make it up any time i know how id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere id know if he <unk> to eat the onions i know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out kiss then would send them all spinning however <unk> well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that i wouldnt so much mind id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a <unk> to her with his <unk> kind of a manner like he did to me though i had the devils own job to get it out of him though i liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen i was rolling the potato cake theres something i want to say to you only for i put him off letting on i was in a temper with my hands and arms full of <unk> flour in any case i let out too much the night before talking of dreams so i didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always <unk> me josie whenever he was there meaning him of course <unk> me over and when i said i washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always <unk> on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the <unk> when they come out with something the kind he is what <unk> him i dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like lord <unk> i said i liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged <unk> though she didnt like it so much the day i was in fits of laughing with the <unk> i couldnt stop about all my <unk> falling out one after another with the mass of hair i had youre always in great humour she said yes because it <unk> her because she knew what it meant because i used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt <unk> the door much after we were married i wonder what shes got like now after living with that <unk> husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time i saw her she must have been just after a row with him because i saw on the moment she was <unk> to draw down a conversation about <unk> and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me o yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his <unk> boots on when the <unk> takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad poldy anyhow whatever he does always <unk> his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always <unk> his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for for a postcard u p up o sweetheart may wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that id rather die times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way i do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that <unk> that poisoned her husband for what i wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the <unk> <unk> to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be <unk> <unk> drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white <unk> she put in his tea off <unk> wasnt it i wonder why they call it that if i asked him hed say its from the greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been <unk> in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged o she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they theyre all so different boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was <unk> when i was in the d b c with poldy laughing and trying to listen i was <unk> my foot we both <unk> teas and plain bread and butter i saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when i stood up and asked the girl where it was what do i care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down <unk> all myself always with some brandnew <unk> every other week such a long one i did i forgot my <unk> gloves on the seat behind that i never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the irish times lost in the ladies <unk> d b c dame street <unk> return to mrmarion bloom and i saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when i looked back and i went there for tea days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because i was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if i only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice <unk> ill stick him for one and a gold <unk> i dont like my foot so much still i made him spend once with my foot the night after <unk> <unk> of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to <unk> and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the <unk> in lombard street west and another time it was my <unk> boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung i could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that i what did he say i could give points in to <unk> <unk> and beat her what does that mean i asked him i forget what he said because the <unk> edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the <unk> dairy thats so polite i think i saw his face before somewhere i noticed him when i was <unk> the butter so i took my time bartell <unk> too that he used to make fun of when he <unk> kissing me on the choir stairs after i sang <unk> <unk> maria what are we waiting for o my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his <unk> voice too my low notes he was always <unk> about if you can believe him i liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that i dont see anything so terrible about it ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along <unk> square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and i had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to <unk> the shape of my bedroom so i let him keep it as if i forgot it to think of me when i saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always <unk> at those <unk> things on the <unk> with their skirts blowing up to their <unk> even when milly and i were out with him at the open air <unk> that one in the cream <unk> standing right against the sun so he could see every <unk> she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain i saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the <unk> cross road with a new <unk> on him with the muffler in the <unk> colours to show off his <unk> and the brown hat looking <unk> as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going i could feel him coming along <unk> after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so i <unk> and stopped then he <unk> me to say yes till i took off my glove slowly watching him he said my <unk> sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till i promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket o maria <unk> he did look a big fool <unk> in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and <unk> of me to lift the orange petticoat i had on with the <unk> <unk> that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if i didnt so <unk> he would too and ruin his new <unk> you never know what <unk> theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so i lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way i used to gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public i was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a <unk> all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say i left my purse in the <unk> and had to go back for it what a <unk> then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have i <unk> you with my eyelids down of course he saw i wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool <unk> doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades i hate an <unk> man and if i knew what it meant of course i had to say no for form sake dont understand you i said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in gibraltar with that word i couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day i liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the big poppies because mine was the th then i wrote the night he kissed my heart at <unk> barn i couldnt <unk> it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like gardner i hope hell come on monday as he said at the same time four i hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the <unk> then its somebody and you all <unk> or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old <unk> goodwin called about the concert in lombard street and i just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor i had to say im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more <unk> nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the <unk> today i thought it was a <unk> first him sending the port and the peaches first and i was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when i knew his <unk> at the door he must have been a bit late because it was after when i saw the dedalus girls coming from school i never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly id want to get it looked after when i threw the penny to that lame sailor for england home and beauty when i was whistling there is a charming girl i love and i hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to belfast just as well he has to go to ennis his fathers anniversary the th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any <unk> went on in the new bed i couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant <unk> with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the <unk> concert at <unk> <unk> boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the <unk> with the soup <unk> about taking <unk> of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us <unk> and <unk> for the <unk> to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the <unk> class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so <unk> sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to cork i suppose that was done out of <unk> on him o i love <unk> in a train or a car with lovely soft <unk> i wonder will he take a st class for me he might want to do it in the train by <unk> the guard well o i suppose <unk> be the usual <unk> of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an <unk> man that common <unk> that left us alone in the carriage that day going to howth id like to find out something about him or <unk> perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose i never came back what would they say <unk> with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert i sang at where its over a year ago when was it st <unk> hall <unk> st little <unk> of <unk> they have now singing <unk> <unk> and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a <unk> for lord <unk> when i had the <unk> of it all and poldy not irish enough was it him <unk> it this time i wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the <unk> mater by going around saying he was putting lead kindly light to music i put him up to that till the <unk> found out he was a <unk> thumping the piano lead thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them sinner fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual <unk> and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man <unk> is he well he doesnt look it thats all i can say still it must have been him he knew there was a <unk> i hate the mention of their politics after the war that <unk> and <unk> and <unk> where gardner <unk> <unk> g th <unk> nd east <unk> <unk> of <unk> fever he was a lovely fellow in <unk> and just the right height over me im sure he was brave too he said i was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and i so hot as i never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old <unk> paul and the rest of the other old <unk> go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any <unk> men there were with their fever if he was even <unk> shot it wouldnt have been so bad i love to see a regiment pass in <unk> the first time i saw the spanish cavalry at la <unk> it was lovely after looking across the bay from <unk> all the lights of the rock like <unk> or those sham battles on the acres the black watch with their <unk> in time at the march past the th <unk> the prince of wales own or the <unk> o the <unk> theyre grand or the <unk> that won <unk> his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in belfast after what i gave him <unk> lovely linen up there or one of those nice <unk> things i must buy a <unk> like i had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be <unk> going round with him <unk> <unk> those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the <unk> there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married o let them all go and <unk> themselves for the fat lot i care he has plenty of money and hes not a <unk> man so somebody better get it out of him if i could find out whether he likes me i looked a bit <unk> of course when i looked close in the <unk> <unk> a mirror never gives you the expression besides <unk> down on me like that all the time with his big <unk> hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way <unk> told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his <unk> <unk> can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly <unk> i know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the <unk> tearing up the tickets and <unk> blazes because he lost quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of <unk> tip <unk> him to the lowest <unk> that <unk> he was making free with me after the glencree dinner coming back that long <unk> over the featherbed mountain after the lord mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes val dillon that big heathen i first noticed him at <unk> when i was cracking the nuts with my teeth i wished i could have picked every <unk> of that <unk> out of my fingers it was so tasty and <unk> and as tender as anything only for i didnt want to eat everything on my plate those <unk> and <unk> were <unk> silver too i wish i had some i could easily have slipped a couple into my <unk> when i was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a <unk> for the bit you put down your throat we have to be <unk> for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great <unk> to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on i want at least two other good <unk> for one thing and but i dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all i think didnt he say yes and half the girls in gibraltar never wore them either naked as god made them that <unk> singing her <unk> she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of <unk> stockings is <unk> after one days wear i could have brought them back to <unk> this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and <unk> the whole thing and one of those <unk> <unk> id want <unk> cheap in the <unk> with elastic <unk> on the hips he saved the one i have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line <unk> that <unk> broad appearance across the lower back to <unk> flesh my belly is a bit too big ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am i getting too fond of it the last they sent from <unk> was as flat as a <unk> he makes his money easy larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at <unk> a cottage cake and a bottle of <unk> he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink god spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or i must do a few breathing exercises i wonder is that <unk> any good might <unk> it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much i have the violet pair i wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first o no there was the face lotion i finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new i told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it god only knows whether he did after all i said to him ill know by the bottle anyway if not i suppose ill only have to wash in my piss like <unk> or <unk> with some of that <unk> and violet i thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much <unk> where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when i get it ill <unk> it around i tell you in fine style i always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot <unk> and mincing if i buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they <unk> no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the <unk> whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and <unk> up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know <unk> no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the years more i have of life up to no im what am i at all ill be in september will i what o well look at that <unk> shes much older than me i saw her when i was out last week her <unk> on the <unk> she was a lovely woman <unk> head of hair on her down to her waist <unk> it back like that like kitty <unk> in <unk> street st thing i did every morning to look across see her <unk> it as if she loved it and was full of it pity i only got to know her the day before we left and that <unk> the jersey lily the prince of wales was in love with i suppose hes like the first man going the <unk> only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black <unk> id like to try a beauty up to what was she there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of master <unk> somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her <unk> fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant i hate that pretending of all things with that old <unk> face on him anybody can see its not true and that ruby and fair tyrants he brought me that twice i remember when i came to page the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a <unk> <unk> sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the <unk> out of her <unk> after the ball was over like the infant jesus in the <unk> at <unk> in the blessed virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and i thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured h r h he was in gibraltar the year i was born i bet he found <unk> there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit <unk> then i wouldnt be here as i am he ought to chuck that freeman with the paltry few shillings he <unk> out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he <unk> <unk> about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today i wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be <unk> about for <unk> when he could have been in <unk> still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up i could have got him <unk> there to be the <unk> he gave me a great <unk> once or twice first he was as stiff as the <unk> really and truly mrbloom only i felt rotten simply with the old <unk> dress that i lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again i bought it simply to please him i knew it was no good by the finish pity i changed my mind of going to <unk> and burns as i said and not <unk> it was just like the shop itself <unk> sale a lot of <unk> i hate those rich <unk> get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and <unk> <unk> everything he can <unk> off the <unk> into it if i went by his <unk> every blessed hat i put on does that suit me yes take that thats <unk> the one like a <unk> standing up miles off my head he said <unk> me or the <unk> one coming down on my <unk> on pins and needles about the <unk> in that place in grafton street i had the <unk> to bring him into and she as <unk> as ever she could be with her <unk> saying im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but i stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked poldy <unk> as usual like the soup but i could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case im extremely sorry mr bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife i just half smiled i know my chest was out that way at the door when he said im extremely sorry and im sure you were yes i think he made them a bit <unk> sucking them like that so long he made me <unk> <unk> he calls them i had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the <unk> gets for the least thing ill get him to keep that up and ill take those eggs <unk> up with <unk> <unk> them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made the same in case of twins theyre supposed to <unk> beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a <unk> no wonder they hide it with a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when i was passing pretending he was <unk> standing out for me to see it with his <unk> up to one side the queens own they were a nice lot its well the <unk> relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly i passed outside the <unk> <unk> near the <unk> street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was of the <unk> of the world o and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with poldy after the <unk> party oranges and <unk> to make you feel nice and watery i went into of them it was so biting cold i couldnt keep it when was that the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the <unk> <unk> there to see me <unk> in the <unk> place <unk> i tried to draw a picture of it before i tore it up like a <unk> or something i wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats <unk> when he said i could <unk> for a picture naked to some rich fellow in holles street when he lost the job in <unk> and i was selling the clothes and <unk> in the coffee palace would i be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or im a little like that dirty bitch in that spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that i asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some <unk> about the <unk> he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the <unk> i had to <unk> out arent they <unk> trying to hurt you i had a great breast of milk with milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said i could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no with the <unk> penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for i snapped up the <unk> to my face that was his <unk> hurt me they used to <unk> her till he got doctor brady to give me the <unk> <unk> i had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was <unk> and <unk> than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything i declare somebody ought to put him in the <unk> if i only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of master poldy yes and its so much <unk> the skin much an hour he was at them im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant i had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman i can feel his mouth o lord i must stretch myself i wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that i feel all fire inside me or if i could dream it when he made me spend the nd time <unk> me behind with his finger i was coming for about minutes with my legs round him i had to <unk> him after o lord i wanted to shout out all <unk> of things <unk> or <unk> or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank god some of them want you to be so nice about it i noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk i gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute thursday friday one saturday two sunday three o lord i cant wait till monday <unk> train somewhere whistling the strength those <unk> have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of them all sides like the end of loves old <unk> the poor men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in those <unk> <unk> <unk> it was today im glad i burned the half of those old <unk> and photo bits leaving things like that lying about hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the w c i’ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last <unk> paper and all those old <unk> i <unk> out of the hall making the place <unk> than it is that rain was lovely and <unk> just after my beauty sleep i thought it was going to get like gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the <unk> came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their rock mountain they think is so great with the red <unk> here and there the <unk> and they all <unk> and the smell of the rainwater in those <unk> watching the sun all the time <unk> down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend mr <unk> sent me from the b <unk> paris what a shame my dearest <unk> she wrote on it she was

when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the <unk> at la <unk> when that <unk> <unk> was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them <unk> you to walk up <unk> hill then for example at that picnic all <unk> up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why i was afraid when that other <unk> old bull began to charge the <unk> with the <unk> and the things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo <unk> sure the women were as bad in their nice white <unk> <unk> all the whole insides out of those poor horses i never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog <unk> in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever i suppose theyre

with father and captain grove i looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met i felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing i remember after when i looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like thomas in the shadow of <unk> i had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose i didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but i could have stopped it in time she gave me the <unk> to read that was the first i read of <unk> <unk> east <unk> i read and the shadow of <unk> <unk> wood henry <unk> by that other woman i lent him <unk> with <unk> photo in it so as he see i wasnt without and lord <unk> <unk> <unk> molly <unk> she gave me by <unk> on account of the name i dont like books with a molly in them like that one he brought me
