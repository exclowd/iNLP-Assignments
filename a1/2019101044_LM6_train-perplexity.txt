how are you dedalus	19.842628479003906
yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the city arms hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his <unk> to make himself interesting for that old <unk> mrriordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest <unk> ever was actually afraid to lay out d for her <unk> spirit telling me all her <unk> she had too much old chat in her about politics and <unk> and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first god help the world if all the women were her sort down on <unk> and <unk> of course nobody wanted her to wear them i suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice i hope ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a <unk> woman certainly and her <unk> talk about mrriordan here and mrriordan there i suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always <unk> to get up under my petticoats especially then still i like that in him polite to old women like that and <unk> and <unk> too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but i suppose id have to <unk> it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as im not yes because theyre so weak and <unk> when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose <unk> youd think it was o <unk> and that <unk> one off the south circular when he <unk> his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf mountain the day i wore that dress miss <unk> bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a <unk> bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides i hate <unk> and <unk> when he cut his toe with the razor <unk> his corns afraid hed get <unk> but if it was a thing i was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it <unk> it hynes kept me who did i meet ah yes i met do you remember menton and who else who let me see that big <unk> i saw him and he not long married <unk> with a young girl at <unk> <unk> and turned my back on him when he <unk> out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the <unk> to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big <unk> i ever met and thats called a solicitor only for i hate having a long <unk> in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as i do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when i came into the front room to show him <unk> death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a <unk> in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to <unk> any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that i care two <unk> now who he does it with or knew before that way though id like to find out so long as i dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that <unk> that mary we had in <unk> terrace <unk> out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice i had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when i found the long hair on his coat without that one when i went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course <unk> servants then <unk> that she could eat at our table on christmas day if you please o no thank you not in my house <unk> my potatoes and the oysters per <unk> going out to see her aunt if you please common <unk> so it was but i was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof o yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but i told her what i thought of her <unk> me to go out to be alone with her i wouldnt lower myself to <unk> on them the garters i found in her room the friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when i gave her her weeks notice i saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself <unk> only for the damn <unk> and throwing out the dirt i gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house i couldnt even touch him if i thought he was with a dirty <unk> liar and <unk> like that one <unk> it up to my face and singing about the place in the w c too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the <unk> in my hand there <unk> another i just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young may moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said im <unk> out and going to the gaiety though im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case god knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless i paid some <unk> boy to do it since i cant do it myself a young boy would like me id <unk> him a little alone with him if we were id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him <unk> him i know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that <unk> drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the <unk> yes with a bishop yes i would because i told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews <unk> gardens when i was <unk> that <unk> thing a stranger to dublin what place was it and so on about the <unk> and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german <unk> is it yes imagine im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply <unk> for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and <unk> him first you sometimes love to <unk> when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself i wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost <unk> you then i hate that confession when i used to go to father <unk> he touched me father and what harm if he did where and i said on the canal bank like a fool but <unk> on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes o lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it i forget no father and i always think of the real father what did he want to know for when i already confessed it to god he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always i wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he id say by the <unk> in his <unk> i wonder did he know me in the box i could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them id like to be <unk> by one in his <unk> and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to h h the pope for a penance i wonder was he satisfied with me one thing i didnt like his <unk> me behind going away so <unk> in the hall though i laughed im not a horse or an ass am i i suppose he was thinking of his fathers i wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am i in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the <unk> kind of paste they stick their bills up with some <unk> id like to <unk> those <unk> green and yellow expensive drinks those <unk> <unk> drink with the opera hats i <unk> once with my finger dipped out of that american that had the <unk> talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because i felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment i popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up god be merciful to us i thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when i blessed myself and said a hail mary like those awful <unk> in gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no god what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of <unk> the candle i lit that evening in <unk> street chapel for the month of may see it brought its luck though hed <unk> if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when i lit the lamp because he must have come or times with that <unk> big red brute of a thing he has i thought the vein or whatever the <unk> they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after i took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and <unk> and <unk> it like iron or some kind of a thick <unk> standing all the time he must have eaten oysters i think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no i never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a <unk> driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined <unk> look in his eye i had to <unk> my eyes still he <unk> such a <unk> amount of spunk in him when i made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time i let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what i went through with milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and mina <unk> husband give us a swing out of your <unk> <unk> her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called <unk> or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it <unk> the child is a black the last time i was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like <unk> or i dont know what supposing i <unk> having another not off him though still if he was married im sure hed have a fine strong child but i dont know poldy has more spunk in him yes <unk> be awfully jolly i suppose it was meeting josie powell and the funeral and thinking about me and boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if <unk> do him any good i know they were <unk> a bit when i came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of georgina <unk> <unk> and then he wanted to <unk> it down my neck it was on account of not <unk> to see her a <unk> that was why we had the <unk> row over politics he began it not me when he said about our lord being a <unk> at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything i was <unk> with myself after for giving in only for i knew he was gone on me and the first <unk> he said he was he <unk> me so much i couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of <unk> things especially about the body and the inside i often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician i could always hear his voice talking when the room was <unk> and watch him after that i <unk> i had a <unk> on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and i said over to floey and he made me the present of <unk> <unk> and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that i could quite easily get him to make it up any time i know how id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere id know if he <unk> to eat the onions i know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out kiss then would send them all spinning however <unk> well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that i wouldnt so much mind id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a <unk> to her with his <unk> kind of a manner like he did to me though i had the devils own job to get it out of him though i liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen i was rolling the potato cake theres something i want to say to you only for i put him off letting on i was in a temper with my hands and arms full of <unk> flour in any case i let out too much the night before talking of dreams so i didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always <unk> me josie whenever he was there meaning him of course <unk> me over and when i said i washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always <unk> on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the <unk> when they come out with something the kind he is what <unk> him i dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like lord <unk> i said i liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged <unk> though she didnt like it so much the day i was in fits of laughing with the <unk> i couldnt stop about all my <unk> falling out one after another with the mass of hair i had youre always in great humour she said yes because it <unk> her because she knew what it meant because i used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt <unk> the door much after we were married i wonder what shes got like now after living with that <unk> husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time i saw her she must have been just after a row with him because i saw on the moment she was <unk> to draw down a conversation about <unk> and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me o yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his <unk> boots on when the <unk> takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad poldy anyhow whatever he does always <unk> his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always <unk> his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for for a postcard u p up o sweetheart may wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that id rather die times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way i do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that <unk> that poisoned her husband for what i wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the <unk> <unk> to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be <unk> <unk> drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white <unk> she put in his tea off <unk> wasnt it i wonder why they call it that if i asked him hed say its from the greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been <unk> in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged o she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they theyre all so different boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was <unk> when i was in the d b c with poldy laughing and trying to listen i was <unk> my foot we both <unk> teas and plain bread and butter i saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when i stood up and asked the girl where it was what do i care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down <unk> all myself always with some brandnew <unk> every other week such a long one i did i forgot my <unk> gloves on the seat behind that i never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the irish times lost in the ladies <unk> d b c dame street <unk> return to mrmarion bloom and i saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when i looked back and i went there for tea days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because i was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if i only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice <unk> ill stick him for one and a gold <unk> i dont like my foot so much still i made him spend once with my foot the night after <unk> <unk> of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to <unk> and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the <unk> in lombard street west and another time it was my <unk> boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung i could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that i what did he say i could give points in to <unk> <unk> and beat her what does that mean i asked him i forget what he said because the <unk> edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the <unk> dairy thats so polite i think i saw his face before somewhere i noticed him when i was <unk> the butter so i took my time bartell <unk> too that he used to make fun of when he <unk> kissing me on the choir stairs after i sang <unk> <unk> maria what are we waiting for o my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his <unk> voice too my low notes he was always <unk> about if you can believe him i liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that i dont see anything so terrible about it ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along <unk> square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and i had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to <unk> the shape of my bedroom so i let him keep it as if i forgot it to think of me when i saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always <unk> at those <unk> things on the <unk> with their skirts blowing up to their <unk> even when milly and i were out with him at the open air <unk> that one in the cream <unk> standing right against the sun so he could see every <unk> she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain i saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the <unk> cross road with a new <unk> on him with the muffler in the <unk> colours to show off his <unk> and the brown hat looking <unk> as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going i could feel him coming along <unk> after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so i <unk> and stopped then he <unk> me to say yes till i took off my glove slowly watching him he said my <unk> sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till i promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket o maria <unk> he did look a big fool <unk> in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and <unk> of me to lift the orange petticoat i had on with the <unk> <unk> that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if i didnt so <unk> he would too and ruin his new <unk> you never know what <unk> theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so i lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way i used to gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public i was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a <unk> all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say i left my purse in the <unk> and had to go back for it what a <unk> then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have i <unk> you with my eyelids down of course he saw i wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool <unk> doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades i hate an <unk> man and if i knew what it meant of course i had to say no for form sake dont understand you i said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in gibraltar with that word i couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day i liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the big poppies because mine was the th then i wrote the night he kissed my heart at <unk> barn i couldnt <unk> it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like gardner i hope hell

never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old <unk> paul and the rest of the other old <unk> go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any <unk> men there were with their fever if he was even <unk> shot it wouldnt have been so bad i love to see a regiment pass in <unk> the first time i saw the spanish cavalry at la <unk> it was lovely after looking across the bay from <unk> all the lights of the rock like <unk> or those sham battles on the acres the black watch with their <unk> in time at the march past the th <unk> the prince of wales

too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way <unk> told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his <unk> <unk> can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly <unk> i know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the <unk> tearing up the tickets and <unk> blazes because he lost quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of <unk> tip <unk> him to the lowest <unk> that <unk> he was making free with me after the glencree dinner coming back that long <unk> over the featherbed mountain after the lord mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes val dillon that big heathen i first noticed him at <unk> when i was cracking the nuts with my teeth i wished i could have picked every <unk> of that <unk> out of my fingers it was so tasty and <unk> and as tender as anything only for i didnt want to eat everything on my plate those <unk> and <unk> were <unk> silver too i wish i had some i could easily have slipped a couple into my <unk> when i was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a <unk> for the bit you put down your throat we have to be <unk> for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great <unk> to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on i want at least two other good <unk> for one thing and but i dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all i think didnt he say yes and half the girls in gibraltar never wore them either naked as god made them that <unk> singing her <unk> she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of <unk> stockings is <unk> after one days wear i could have brought them back to <unk> this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and <unk> the whole thing and one of those <unk> <unk> id want <unk> cheap in the <unk> with elastic <unk> on the hips he saved the one i have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line <unk> that <unk> broad appearance across the lower back to <unk> flesh my belly is a bit too big ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am i getting too fond of it the last they sent from <unk> was as flat as a <unk> he makes his money easy larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at <unk> a cottage cake and a bottle of <unk> he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink god spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or i must do a few breathing exercises i wonder is that <unk> any good might <unk> it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much i have the violet pair i wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first o no there was the face lotion i finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new i told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it god only knows whether he did after all i said to him ill know by the bottle anyway if not i suppose ill only have to wash in my piss like <unk> or <unk> with some of that <unk> and violet i thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much <unk> where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when i get it ill <unk> it around i tell you in fine style i always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot <unk> and mincing if i buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they <unk> no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the <unk> whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and <unk> up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know <unk> no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the years more i have of life up to no im what am i at all ill be in september will i what o well look at that <unk> shes much older than me i saw her when i was out last week her <unk> on the <unk> she was a lovely woman <unk> head of hair on her down to her waist <unk> it back like that like kitty <unk> in <unk> street st thing i did every morning to look across see her <unk> it as if she loved it and was full of it pity i only got to know her the day before we left and that <unk> the jersey lily the prince of wales was in love with i suppose hes like the first man going the <unk> only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black <unk> id like to try a beauty up to what was she there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of master <unk> somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her <unk> fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant i hate that pretending of all things with that old <unk> face on him anybody can see its not true and that ruby and fair tyrants he brought me that twice i remember when i came to page the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a <unk> <unk> sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the <unk> out of her <unk> after the ball was over like the infant jesus in the <unk> at <unk> in the blessed virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and i thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured h r h he was in gibraltar the year i was born i bet he found <unk> there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit <unk> then i wouldnt be here as i am he ought to chuck that freeman with the paltry few shillings he <unk> out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he <unk> <unk> about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today i wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be <unk> about for <unk> when he could have been in <unk> still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up i could have got him <unk> there to be the <unk> he gave me a great <unk> once or twice first he was as stiff as the <unk> really and truly mrbloom only i felt rotten simply with the old <unk> dress that i lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again i bought it simply to please him i knew it was no good by the finish pity i changed my mind of going to <unk> and burns as i said and not <unk> it was just like the shop itself <unk> sale a lot of <unk> i hate those rich <unk> get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and <unk> <unk> everything he can <unk> off the <unk> into it if i went by his <unk> every blessed hat i put on does that suit me yes take that thats <unk> the one like a <unk> standing up miles off my head he said <unk> me or the <unk> one coming down on my <unk> on pins and needles about the <unk> in that place in grafton street i had the <unk> to bring him into and she as <unk> as ever she could be with her <unk> saying im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but i stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked poldy <unk> as usual like the soup but i could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case im extremely sorry mr bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife i just half smiled i know my chest was out that way at the door when he said im extremely sorry and im sure you were yes i think he made them a bit <unk> sucking them like that so long he made me <unk> <unk> he calls them i had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the <unk> gets for the least thing ill get him to keep that up and ill take those eggs <unk> up with <unk> <unk> them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made the same in case of twins theyre supposed to <unk> beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a <unk> no wonder they hide it with a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when i was passing pretending he was <unk> standing out for me to see it with his <unk> up to one side the queens own they were a nice lot its well the <unk> relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly i passed outside the <unk> <unk> near the <unk> street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was of the <unk> of the world o and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with poldy after the <unk> party oranges and <unk> to make you feel nice and watery i went into of them it was so biting cold i couldnt keep it when was that the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the <unk> <unk> there to see me <unk> in the <unk> place <unk> i tried to draw a picture of it before i tore it up like a <unk> or something i wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats <unk> when he said i could <unk> for a picture naked to some rich fellow in holles street when he lost the job in <unk> and i was selling the clothes and <unk> in the coffee palace would i be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or im a little like that dirty bitch in that spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that i asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some <unk> about the <unk> he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the <unk> i had to <unk> out arent they <unk> trying to hurt you i had a great breast of milk with milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said i could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no with the <unk> penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for i snapped up the <unk> to my face that was his <unk> hurt me they used to <unk> her till he got doctor brady to give me the <unk> <unk> i had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was <unk> and <unk> than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything i declare somebody ought to put him in the <unk> if i only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of master poldy yes and its so much <unk> the skin much an hour he was at them im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant i had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman i can feel his mouth o lord i must stretch myself i wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that i feel all fire inside me or if i could dream it when he made me spend the nd time <unk> me behind with his finger i was coming for about minutes with my legs round him i had to <unk> him after o lord i wanted to shout out all <unk> of things <unk> or <unk> or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank god some of them want you to be so nice about it i noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk i gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute thursday friday one saturday two sunday three o lord i cant wait till monday <unk> train somewhere whistling the strength those <unk> have in them like big

<unk> was the first when i was in bed that morning and <unk> brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when i asked her to hand me and i pointing at them i couldnt think of the word a <unk> to open it with ah <unk> <unk> old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near or a her face a mass of <unk> with all her religion <unk> because she never could get over the <unk> fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the union jack flying with all her <unk> because drunken english sailors took all the rock from them and because i didnt run into mass often enough in santa maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her <unk> of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing times on easter sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the <unk> to the dying blessing herself for his <unk> an <unk> he signed it i near jumped out of my skin i wanted to pick him up when i saw him following me along the <unk> real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but i never thought hed write making an <unk> i had it inside my petticoat <unk> all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the <unk> <unk> to find out by the <unk> or the language of stamps singing i remember shall i wear a white rose and i wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was <unk> young i put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did i tell him i was engaged for for fun to the son of a spanish nobleman named don <unk> de la <unk> and he believed me that i was to be married to him in years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that <unk> a few things i told him true about myself just for him to be <unk> the spanish girls he didnt like i suppose one of them wouldnt have him i got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the <unk> and the <unk> till i taught him <unk> he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left may yes it was may when the infant king of spain was born im always like that in the spring id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the <unk> near <unk> tower i told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old <unk> <unk> they sent to <unk> without a tail <unk> all over the show on each others back <unk> said she was a regular old rock <unk> <unk> the <unk> out of <unk> farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me i had that white blouse on open in the front to <unk> him as much as i could without too <unk> they were just beginning to be plump i said i was tired we lay over the <unk> <unk> a wild place i suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the <unk> and <unk> and those <unk> rocks and saint <unk> cave with the <unk> or whatever they call them hanging down and <unk> all the mud <unk> my boots im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the <unk> boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he <unk> them outside they love doing that its the <unk> there i was leaning over him with my white <unk> hat to take the <unk> out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had i could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but i wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child <unk> that old servant <unk> told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after i tried with the <unk> but i was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with <unk> theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes o yes i pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but i opened my legs i wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because i had a skirt opening up the side i <unk> the life out of him first <unk> him i loved <unk> that dog in the hotel <unk> <unk> his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same i liked him like that moaning i made him blush a little when i got over him that way when i unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them molly darling he called me what was his name jack joe harry mulvey was it yes i think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so i went round to the <unk> everything was <unk> moustache had he he said hed come back lord its just like yesterday to me and if i was married hed do it to me and i promised him yes <unk> id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or <unk> its nearly years if i said <unk> <unk> he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to <unk> who i might recognise him hes young still about perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what i did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the <unk> i was a bit wild after when i blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from <unk> <unk> and <unk> it lord what a bang all the <unk> and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old <unk> and the jews <unk> pretending to read out the hebrew on them i wanted to fire his <unk> he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as i settled it straight h m s <unk> swinging my hat that old bishop that spoke off the altar his long <unk> about womans higher <unk> about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman <unk> god send him sense and me more money i suppose theyre called after him i never thought that would be my name bloom when i used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or <unk> for the butcher and <unk> m bloom youre looking blooming josie used to say after i married him well its better than breen or <unk> does <unk> or those awful names with bottom in them <unk> or some other kind of a bottom mulvey i wouldnt go mad about either or suppose i divorced him mrboylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the lord knows after the lovely one she had <unk> <unk> the fun we had running along <unk> road to <unk> point twisting in and out all round the other side of jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like <unk> little ones now when she runs up the stairs i loved looking down at them i was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white <unk> pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to <unk> he was to write the <unk> those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere i went up <unk> hill to the <unk> that sunday morning with captain <unk> that was dead <unk> like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board i wore that frock from the b <unk> paris and the coral <unk> the <unk> shining i could see over to <unk> almost the bay of <unk> white and the <unk> mountain with <unk> on it and the <unk> like a river so clear harry molly darling i was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the <unk> weeks and weeks i kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that gibraltar only that cheap <unk> <unk> that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else i wanted to give him a <unk> he gave me that clumsy <unk> ring for luck that i gave gardner going to south africa where those boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well <unk> all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an <unk> or <unk> still it must have been pure <unk> gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the <unk> shower from africa and that <unk> ship that came up to the harbour marie the marie <unk> no he hadnt a moustache that was gardner yes i can see his face <unk> <unk> that train again weeping tone once in the dear <unk> days <unk> call close my eyes breath my lips forward kiss sad look eyes open piano ere <unk> the world the <unk> began i hate that <unk> comes loves

heard <unk> in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a <unk> as white as a sheet <unk> out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the <unk> benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the lord knows still its the feeling especially now with milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to <unk> <unk> where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and boylan thats why he did it im certain the way he <unk> and <unk> everything out i couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless i <unk> the door first gave me the <unk> coming in without knocking first when i put the chair against the door just as i was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the <unk> all day put her in a <unk> with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little <unk> statue with her <unk> and <unk> before she left that i got that little italian boy to <unk> so that you cant see the join for shillings wouldnt even <unk> the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands i noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say i pretend things can he im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me

of the button i <unk> on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me i tell you only i <unk> to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last <unk> too split in <unk> see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle <unk> and i had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the <unk> before all the people passing they all look at her like me when i was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great <unk> too in her own way at the only way in the theatre royal take your foot away out of that i hate people touching me afraid of her life id crush her skirt with the <unk> a lot of that touching must go on in <unk> in the crush

theyre all right i wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy <unk> all sides asking me if what i did had an <unk> odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if i <unk> it all over his <unk> old face for him with all my <unk> i suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what i thought he was talking about the rock of gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only i like letting myself down after in the hole as far as i can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it i suppose i always used to know by <unk> when she was a child whether she had <unk> or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had i frequent <unk> where do those old fellows get all the words they have <unk> with his <unk> eyes on me cocked sideways i wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or god knows what else still i liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying <unk> o anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my precious one everything connected with your glorious body everything <unk> that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some <unk> book that he had me always at myself and times a day sometimes and i said i hadnt are you sure o yes i said i am quite sure in a way that shut him up i knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me i dont know how the first night ever we met when i was living in <unk> terrace we stood staring at one another for about minutes as if we met somewhere i suppose on account of my being <unk> looking after my mother he used to <unk> me the things he said with the half <unk> smile on him and all the <unk> said he was going to stand for a member of parliament o wasnt i the born fool to believe all his <unk> about home rule and the land league sending me that long <unk> of a song out of the huguenots to sing in french to be more <unk> o <unk> pays de la <unk> that i never even sang once explaining and <unk> about religion and <unk> he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very st opportunity he got a chance in <unk> square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the <unk> milk and sulphur soap i used to use and the <unk> still round it o i laughed myself sick at him that day i better not make an <unk> sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he <unk> down to do it i suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard <unk> its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that indian god he took me to show one wet sunday in the museum in kildare street all yellow in a <unk> lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and our lords both put together all over asia <unk> him as hes always <unk> everybody i suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his <unk> mouth damn this <unk> thing anyway wheres this those <unk> are ah yes i know i hope the old press doesnt <unk> ah i knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her o this nuisance of a thing i hope <unk> have something better for us in the other world <unk> ourselves up god help us thats all right for tonight now the <unk> old <unk> bed always reminds me of old cohen i suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from lord <unk> that i used to admire when i was a little girl because i told him easy piano o i like my bed god here we are as bad as ever after years how many houses were we in at all <unk> terrace and <unk> terrace and lombard street and holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the <unk> march pretending to help the men with our sticks of furniture and then the city arms hotel worse and worse says <unk> <unk> that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it <unk> and <unk> and mr <unk> and <unk> either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our <unk> or he goes and gives <unk> well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the freeman too like the rest on account of those sinner fein or the <unk> then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by <unk> lane will give him much consolation that he says is so <unk> and <unk> irish he is indeed <unk> by the <unk> of the trousers i saw on him wait theres <unk> church bells wait quarters the hour wait two <unk> well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody <unk> down into the area if anybody saw him ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first ill look at his shirt to see or ill see if he has that french letter still in his pocketbook i suppose he thinks i dont know <unk> men all their pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the <unk> masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old <unk> or whatever his name is <unk> you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of <unk> theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and <unk> eggs i suppose im nothing any more when i wouldnt let him lick me in holles street one night man man <unk> as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be <unk> so i thought i stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or i dont know what he <unk> that <unk> i dont ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the <unk> with the <unk> i wonder was it her josie off her head with my <unk> hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and boylan though as for her denis as she calls him that <unk> spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when i was with him with milly at the college races that hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his <unk> let us into by the back way he was throwing his <unk> eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down i tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of mr paddy dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral <unk> be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black l boom and tom kernan that drunken little <unk> man that bit his tongue off falling down the <unk> w c drunk in some place or other and martin cunningham and the two <unk> and fanny <unk> husband white head of cabbage <unk> thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the <unk> as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a <unk> day i see it all now <unk> and they

going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if i can help it making fun of him then behind his back i know well when he goes on with his <unk> because he has sense enough not to <unk> every penny piece he <unk> down their

dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the <unk> <unk> he was always on for <unk> too when i sang <unk> with him at <unk> <unk> private opera he had a <unk> glorious voice <unk> dearest goodbye sweetheart sweet heart he always sang it not like bartell <unk> sweet tart goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm <unk> o <unk> <unk> flower we sang <unk> though it was a bit too high for my <unk> even <unk> and he was married at the time to may goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now i wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of italian and im to take <unk> what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me i ought to have got it taken in <unk> that never looks out of fashion still i look young in it i wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not i saw him driving down to the <unk> station with his father and mother i was in mourning thats years ago now yes hed be though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me i heard the <unk> too ticking in the wall of course he <unk> hed go into mourning for the cat i suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord <unk> suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when i saw him at mat <unk> he liked me too i remember they all do wait by god yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when i laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before i thought it meant him but hes no <unk> nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the th card after that the of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and <unk> too the queens and the of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and red s for new garments look at that and didnt i dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it i hope he <unk> long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at i always liked poetry when i was a girl first i thought he was a poet like lord <unk> and not an <unk> of it in his <unk> i thought he was quite different i wonder is he too young hes about wait i was married milly is yesterday what age was he then at <unk> or about i suppose hes or more im not too old for him if hes or i hope hes not that <unk> university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking <unk> cocoa and talking of course he <unk> to understand it all probably he told him he was out of trinity college hes very young to be a professor i hope hes not a professor like goodwin was he was a potent professor of john <unk> they all write about some woman in their poetry well i suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so <unk> coming back on the <unk> from <unk> the <unk> at <unk> point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will i ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a <unk> hid ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star <unk> be a change the lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and billy <unk> ad and <unk> ad and tom the devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer im sure hes very distinguished id like to meet a man like that god not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men i could see down in <unk> strand <unk> from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a god or something and then <unk> into the sea with them why arent all men like that <unk> be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought i could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you i often felt i wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple i wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his <unk> face i would too in a minute even if some of it went down what its only like <unk> or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those <unk> of men i suppose never dream of washing it from years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches im sure <unk> be grand if i can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age ill throw them the st thing in the morning till i see if the <unk> comes out or ill try <unk> the lady herself and see if he comes out ill read and study all i can find or learn a bit off by heart if i knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and i can teach him the other part ill make him feel all over him till he half <unk> under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous o but then what am i going to do about him though no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no <unk> nor no nothing in his nature <unk> us behind like that on my bottom because i didnt call him hugh the <unk> that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so <unk> without even asking permission and standing out that <unk> way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old <unk> in the time of julius caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion god im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old lion would o well i suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt <unk> they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always i wished i was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle john has a thing long i heard those <unk> saying passing the <unk> of <unk> lane my aunt mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt <unk> hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a <unk> men again all over they can pick and <unk> what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind irish street no but were to be always <unk> up theyre not going to be <unk> me up no damn fear once i start i tell you for their stupid <unk> jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of <unk> her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he <unk> it hes <unk> anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in fair tyrants of course the man never even <unk> a nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those <unk> for id like to know i cant help it if im young still can i its a wonder im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never <unk> me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing i suppose who he has any man <unk> kiss a womans bottom id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything <unk> where we havent <unk> of any kind of expression in us all of us the same lumps of <unk> before ever id do that to a man <unk> the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough i kiss the feet of you <unk> theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a <unk> nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be <unk> times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the lord god i was thinking would i go around by the quays there some dark evening where <unk> know me and pick up a sailor off the sea <unk> be hot on for it and not care a pin whose i was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those <unk> <unk> in <unk> had their <unk> <unk> near the <unk> <unk> to try and steal our things if they could i only sent mine there a few times for the name model <unk> sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that <unk> fellow with the fine eyes <unk> a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that k c lives up somewhere this way coming out of <unk> lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the <unk> match of course it was for me he gave it i knew him by his <unk> and the walk and when i turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only i suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease o move over your big carcass out of that for the love of <unk> listen to him the winds that <unk> my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great <unk> don <unk> de la <unk> if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some <unk> between s too in prison for lord knows what he does that i dont know and im to be <unk> around down in the kitchen to get his <unk> his breakfast while hes rolled up like a <unk> will i indeed did you ever see me running id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt i dont care what anybody says <unk> be much better for the world to be <unk> by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and <unk> when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or <unk> every penny they have and <unk> it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what i never had thats why i suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual <unk> house i suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and i none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when i was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that <unk> me altogether i suppose i <unk> to have buried him in that little <unk> jacket i <unk> crying as i was but give it to some poor child but i knew well id never have another our st death too it was we were never the same since o im not going to think myself into the <unk> about that any more i wonder why he wouldnt stay the night i felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of <unk> around the city meeting god knows who <unk> and <unk> his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive <unk> himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent i used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to <unk> none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you i hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of <unk> i suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so <unk> im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room i suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm dedalus i wonder its like those names in gibraltar <unk> <unk> they had the devils queer names there father <unk> of santa maria that gave me the rosary <unk> y <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>

that <unk> <unk> mr <unk> lent me by <unk> with the questions in it all <unk> down the two ways i always knew wed go away in the end i can tell him the spanish and he tell me the italian then hell see im not so <unk> what a pity he didnt stay im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly i could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as i didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the <unk> and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like i never could bear the look of them in <unk> i could do the <unk> the room looks all right since i changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time id have to introduce myself not knowing me from adam very funny wouldnt it im his wife or pretend we were in spain with him half awake without a gods notion where he is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes <unk> be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and <unk> bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for he can make it for im sure im not going to take in <unk> off the street for him if he takes a <unk> of a house like this id love to have a long talk with an intelligent <unk> person id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those <unk> with the <unk> used to sell or yellow and a nice <unk> morning gown that i badly want or a <unk> dressing jacket like the one long ago in <unk> only or ill just give him one more chance ill get up early in the morning im sick of <unk> old bed in any case i might go over to the <unk> to see all the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows <unk> be the st man id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning <unk> dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her <unk> id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when i used to be in the longing way then ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger i suppose hed like my nice cream too i know what ill do ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then <unk>

him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is <unk> yes and damn well <unk> too up to my neck nearly not by him or times <unk> theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet i wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to <unk> him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless i made him stand there and put him into me <unk> a mind to tell him every <unk> and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if i am an <unk> as the thing in the gallery said o much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this <unk> of tears god knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it i suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or he wouldnt have made us the way he did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom ill <unk> open my drawers and <unk> it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then ill tell him i want or perhaps ill tell him i want to buy <unk> then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad i dont want to <unk> it all out of him like other women do i could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a
